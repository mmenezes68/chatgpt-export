NCCs and the research programme\nassociated with it rose to prominence 30 years ago with the article Towards a neu-\nrobiological theory of consciousness by Francis Crick and Christof Koch (1990).\n\nThe notion of a neural correlate of consciousness itself was around before their\nseminal paper. Crick and Koch, for example, cite Logothethis and Schall’s Neu-\nronal correlates of subjective visual perception (1989), which arguably points in the\nsame direction. That paper reports of single neuron recordings of the subjective\nperception of movement. It is therefore far less ambitious than Crick and Koch’s,\nwhich asks generally about the where, when, how, and why of neural activation\ncorrelating with consciousness. But during the reign of cognitivism, where con-\nsciousness was largely ignored, its overall usage was sparse and mainly in passing,\ne.g. when the term is also used by C. L. Hardin (1988, p. 130) in Color for Philoso-\nphers: Unweaving the Rainbow where he talks of the chromatic cells in the visual\ncortex as “the hypothetical neural correlate of ‘consciousness’ ” – arguably shying\naway from such a thorny subject as consciousness by putting it in scare quotes.\nEarlier, we find the term in J. S. Griffith’s A View of the Brain (1967, p. 25) as\npart of a more mathematical model of the brain’s workings. However, before the\nadvent of behaviorism, NCCs where popular enough to be mentioned in the en-\ntry on Psychology in the Encyclopedia Britannica, written by James Ward (1911).\naPhilosophy-Neurosciences-Cognition Otto-von-Guericke Universität Magdeburg\n\nFink, S. B. (2020). A double anniversary for the neural correlates of consciousness: Editorial\nintroduction. Philosophy and the Mind Sciences, 1(II), 1.\nhttps://doi.org/10.33735/phimisci.2020.II.85\n\n©The author(s). https://philosophymindscience.org ISSN: 2699-0369\n\n\n\nSascha Benjamin Fink 2\n\nThis indicated that the idea that conscious processes have neural correlates was\nnot uncommon in 19th century psychology, e.g. when Edmund Gurney (1881, p.\n156) writes that “the movements of mind are correlated with nervous processes”\nor when Mary Whiton Calkins (1892, p. 399) speaks of “cerebral correlates of […]\nintellectual processes”.\n\nSo while Crick and Koch may not have originated the term “neural correlate\nof consciousness”, their article was crucial in pushing it onto the scientific agenda\nby sketching a general research programme guided by the question “Where in\nthe brain are the neural correlates of consciousness?” – which still occupies re-\nsearchers today, 30 years later. The paper therefore deserves to be the most cited\nsource and the central root of our contemporary neuroscience of consciousness.\n\nSpelling the goal of this investigation out in terms of neural correlates (rather\nthan something else) had several advantages and allowed researchers to get an em-\npirical investigation off the ground. First, methods for capturing correlations (un-\nlike more philosophical notions like supervenience, grounding, co-extensionality,\nidentity and so on) is something already within the standard toolbox of empirical\nscience. At its core, it measures the strength of dependence between two variables.\nBernard Baars (1997) made this point explicit: In the NCC-framework, scientists\ntreat consciousness as a variable in experimental set-ups. The goal is to see which\nneural variables co-vary with it. Second, and more importantly, while correla-\ntion may not be fully metaphysically neutral, it is not too restrictive either. Unlike\nneural substrates, constituents, reduction bases, or other notions that are more meta-\nphysically loaded, neural correlates are compatible with a bunch of different but\nmutually excluding metaphysical views on how our neural goings-on relate to con-\nsciousness. Even in Leibnizian parallelistic dualism, there can be a neural correlate\nof a conscious experience, as Ward (1911, p. 600ff) already pointed out. But the\nsame holds for monistic identity theory, where we might think of the correlates as\nways in which one and the same thing is given to us or picked out, introspectively\nor neuroscientifically. Only a denial of the existence of matter or consciousness\n(i.e., eliminativism or irrealism) precludes a search for correlates because there is\nnothing to correlate with. Or one must claim that conscious goings-on lack even\na statistical relation to neural goings-on, which is rare even among proponents\nof enactive, embodied, or extended approaches. Beyond such extreme positions,\nmost metaphysics will allow for something neural correlating with consciousness.\nThis metaphysical promiscuity allowed researchers to bracket ancient but ongoing\nphilosophical debates on the mind-body problem and simply start their empirical\nwork. If coined in terms of correlation, the results will be compatible with most of\nwhat philosophers (eventually or never) converge on. Empirical researchers could\nalso bracket their own varying metaphysical temperaments – some like Popper\n& Eccles (1977) have dualistic, others more reductionistic tendencies. Such diver-\ngences need not hinder fruitful collaboration in a coordinated attempt to find out:\n“Where in the brain are the neural correlates of consciousness?”\n\nWhile elegant in how it opens up avenues for empirical work, theNCC research\nprogramme also raised conceptual, methodological, and empirical questions, some\n\nFink, S.

Consider, for example, that correlation is rela-\ntively cheap as any two variables correlate to some degree. In order to prevent the\nsearch for NCCs from becoming trivial, wemust ask: Which further constraints on\ncorrelation should be imposed to distinguish mere statistical correlates from core\ncorrelates that hint at a foothold of consciousness in the material world? How can\nwe screen off core correlates from enabling conditions or causal factors? How can\nwe best access, categorise or measure the conscious side of the correlation, which\nseems elusively subjective – especially if it might be tied to observable behaviour\nin only a loose sense? How do neural correlates relate to theories of conscious-\nness? How can candidates for core NCCs be tested? How do correlates relate to\ntheories of consciousness? How do correlates of specific experiences (like seeing\nvermillion or smelling burnt toast) relate to correlates of broader conscious states\nlike (like dreaming or waking)? How many different core NCCs should we expect\nfor a given conscious state? How does this research programme relate to embod-\niment and extended views of the mind or to research on artificial consciousness?\nThe list continues.\n\nIn approaching questions like these, the anthology The Neural Correlates of\nConsciousness: Empirical and Conceptual Questions (Metzinger, 2000), edited by\nThomas Metzinger, stands out. Metzinger, who later also served as president for\nthe Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness ten years ago (2009/2010),\nbrought together a wide range of empirical researchers and philosophers and\nthereby illustrated that the self-conception of the budding science of conscious-\nness includes a continuous reflection about the philosophical foundations of\nits empirical side – but also a demand for deriving testable implications from\nphilosophical views on consciousness in order to keep them accountable to\nempirical findings. This anthology also featured a detailed analysis by David\nChalmers (2000) of what a neural correlate of consciousness is supposed to be:\nAn NCC of an experience 𝐶 is the neural state 𝑁 that is minimally sufficient for\nthat experience 𝐶 . Being merely sufficient allows for several neural systems to\ngive rise to a conscious experience. For example, before a stroke, neural area𝑁1 may have brought about experiences as of seeing red, feeling one’s hand,\nor comprehending a word. After recovering from the stroke, these experiences\nmay be brought about by 𝑁2. Neither 𝑁1 nor 𝑁2 is therefore necessary for that\nexperience. But searching for only sufficient criteria might be trivial: The state\nof my whole brain is sufficient for my seeing red now. Thanks to the minimality\ncriterion, we can reject such trivial answers and ask again: “Where in the brain\nare the neural correlates of consciousness?” Chalmers’ definition has become the\ngold standard, the one most often proclaimed to be what NCC-researchers aim to\nfind.\n\nThis special issue of Philosophy and the Mind Sciences celebrates this double\nanniversary: 30 years since the research programme for finding neural correlates\nof consciousness was brought back onto the scientific agenda and 20 years since\nthe standard definition of an NCC was published in a seminal anthology. Here, we\n\nFink, S. B. (2020). A double anniversary for the neural correlates of consciousness: Editorial\nintroduction.

In this issue, seven\noriginal peer-reviewed research papers take up these threads.\n\nTalis Bachmann, Mototaka Suzuki, and Jaan Aru in Dendritic Integration\nTheory: A thalamocortical theory of state and content of consciousness (2020) im-\nprove on the prominent view of thalamo-cortical loops as NCCs. They start from\nten observations motivated by phenomenology and empirical data. A neuroscien-\ntific account of consciousness must explain all ten. Their Dendritic Integration The-\nory focuses specifically on L5p neurones that receive input from both cortex and\nthalamus and thereby can mitigate between the important cortico-cortical process-\ning (relevant for the specificity of what one is conscious of) and thalamo-cortical\nprocessing (relevant for the integration of different conscious features into a uni-\nfied experience). This allows for an interplay between contents of consciousness\nand larger background states being thalamically modulated. They argue that this\nalso accounts for the ability for unconscious cortical processing.\n\nJakob Hohwy and Anil Seth present predictive processing as a framework\nfor progressing the search for NCCs in their Predictive processing as a systematic\nbasis for identifying the neural correlates of consciousness (2020). The problem they\nraise is that there is a discrepancy between theories of consciousness (which are\nnot always cashed out in neural terms), and empirical findings about neural cor-\nrelates of consciousness. They stress that we must distinguish between arbitrary\ncorrelates – statistical coincidences not predicted by any hypothesis or theory –\nand systematic correlates, which are directly implicated by a theory. The goal of\nthe neuroscience of consciousness is to understand, explain and predict mecha-\nnisms facilitating consciousness. For this, we require a theory. But so far, there\nis no convergence onto one. We may facilitate convergence by comparing differ-\nent theories neuroscientifically. In order to cash out theories of consciousness in\nneural terms and make them comparable with each other and neuroscientific data,\nthey suggest predictive processing as a suitable mitigator. Predictive processing as\na framework therefore promises a unification of the field without a commitment\nto a specific theory. This go-between, however, also has the potential to become a\ntheory of consciousness in its own rights.\n\nColin Klein, Tim Bayne, and JakobHohwy question that we should search\nfor neural correlates of consciousness at all in their Explanation in the science of\nconsciousness: From the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) to the difference\nmakers of consciousness (2020). They make the point that the search for NCCs rests\non some controversial assumptions, which culminate in the Lite-Brite-Model: (i)\nthat a neural event brings about a specific experience autonomously and indepen-\ndently of what else goes on in consciousness or the brain, (ii) that an experience is\nuniquely dependent on a single neural element, and (iii) that global changes in con-\nsciousness uniformly affect all occurrent experiences. They contrast this with the\ndifference maker framework. Here, we ask which neural events make a difference\nto consciousness. Not only is this research programme logically more complex, it\n\nFink, S. B. (2020). A double anniversary for the neural correlates of consciousness: Editorial\nintroduction.

The days of\nsearching for NCCs might be numbered.\n\nTomáš Marvan and Michal Polák in their Generality and content-specificity\nin the study of the neural correlates of perceptual consciousness (2020) pick up the\nquestion of what makes any content conscious. This is to them the pivotal question.\nAccording to them, just searching for NCCs is then too broad: The notions must\nbe split up into neural correlates of content (NCc, with a lower case 𝑐) and a general\nneural correlate of consciousness (gNCC), which is the mechanism shared by all\nconscious contents. They assume that when we compare the neural correlates of\nconscious events, we will find the general neural correlate of consciousness as a\nstable part, but combined with varying neural correlates of content (which can, in\nprinciple, occur outside the NCC as well). So it is this broad mechanism that, in\ninteraction, turns the content of a neural representation conscious. They map out\nwhich theories do or don’t allow for such a distinction – which in turn lends itself\nto evaluating such theories if the distinction is accepted.\n\nMatan Mazor and Stephen M. Fleming in their Distinguishing absence of\nawareness from awareness of absence (2020) focus on one of the most important\nparadigms in the search for NCCs, namely the contrastive analysis of trials where\na subject is aware of a stimulus and those where a subject is unaware of a stimulus.\nThey point out that this falls short of what is actually needed: Subjects are not only\naware of stimuli, they sometimes are also aware of the absence of a stimulus. Or,\nvice versa, they can be unaware of the presence of a stimulus but also unaware of\nthe absence of a stimulus. In both cases, the awareness of absence and the aware-\nness of a stimulus, the neural correlate of awareness might be present. Similarly,\nin both the unawareness of a stimulus and the awareness of a stimulus, a neural\ncorrelate of the stimulus may be present. If we do not capture this difference, we\nmight either discard or fail to see relevant neural data. Hence, they argue for a two-\ndimensional report scheme. In concordance with Marvan and Polák, they suggest\nthat this allows for distinguishing between content-specific and content-invariant\nNCCs.\n\nAndy McKilliam (2020) asks the question What is a global state of conscious-\nness? This is a central question to NCC research, specifically regarding the distinc-\ntion between content-specific and content-invariant correlates. A general mech-\nanism for consciousness might also vary when global states vary from wakeful-\nness to drowsiness or to dreaming and so on. Still, such global states might be\ncontent-invariant. In order to research global states of consciousness, we need to\nknow what it is. McKilliam finds all explications currently at play wanting, be\nthey as levels, phenomenal states in their own right, total states constituted by all\noccurrent experiences, phenomenal signatures, or as phenomenal structures. As\na contrast, he presents the capacities account of global states, where global states\nsimply govern what a creature is capable of experiencing and how it is capable of\naccessing these experiences while in that global state. But I need not occurrently\nexercise my capacities in order to have them, e.g. I have the capacity to ride a bike\n\nFink, S. B. (2020).

The controversial upshot is that we\nmay miss NCCs for global states if we only look at neural data correlating with\noccurrent experiences. This suggests a totally new approach for investigating the\nneural correlates of waking, dreaming, being under anaesthesia and so on.\n\nMatthiasMichel andHakwan Lau reportOn the dangers of conflating strong\nand weak versions of a theory of consciousness (2020). They emphasise that we have\nto distinguish markers from constituents and both from correlates of consciousness.\nNeural markers are events that we can exploit and use epistemically as indicators\nof consciousness. In that role, they differ from someone telling us that they are\nconscious mainly in that they are neural, not verbal. Constituents, in contrast,\nlend themselves to reduction because they are what conscious events can actually\nbe identified with. Both are neural correlates, but markers are correlates only in a\nstatistical sense, while constituents go beyond Chalmers’ conception because they\nare also necessary in some sense. In that, neural constitution is more metaphysi-\ncally demanding than correlation – and much harder to prove empirically. Failing\nto make the trifold distinction between neural markers, constituents and corre-\nlates of consciousness might lead to overestimating the scope of a theory. They\nillustrate this with a critique of the Integrated Information Theory: If integration is\nunderstood as a marker of consciousness, then the theory is empirically testable\nand maybe even supported – but the theory becomes untestable if integration is\nunderstood as a constituent of consciousness. Integrated Information Theory in\nthis fundamental reading goes far beyond finding correlates. Instead, it detaches\nitself from empirical findings by claiming something untestable.\n\nThese seven original research papers clearly illustrate on the one hand the im-\npact which NCCs still have on the science of consciousness and on the other hand\nthe controversies this notion still raises. We still make progress and amend both\nthe research programme inaugurated by Crick and Koch 30 years ago as well as\nthe definition of an NCC presented by Chalmers 20 years ago, all in the interdis-\nciplinary, empirically grounded and philosophically open spirit exhibited in the\nanthology by Metzinger. Philosophy and the Mind Sciences will continue this dis-\ncussion in a second issue in 2021 with several more articles. These, like this issue\nas a whole, have been severely affected and hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSo I am especially thankful to all the authors and reviewers for their work during\nthese hard times.

O artigo **\"A Double Anniversary for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness\"**, de **Sascha Benjamin Fink**, é uma introdução editorial ao volume especial da revista *Philosophy and the Mind Sciences* (2020), que comemora:\n\n1. Os **30 anos da publicação do artigo seminal de Crick & Koch (1990)**, que impulsionou o programa de pesquisa dos *Neural Correlates of Consciousness* (NCCs);\n2. E os **20 anos da definição padrão de NCC proposta por David Chalmers (2000)** no livro organizado por Metzinger.\n\nVamos estruturar o estudo em etapas para facilitar a compreensão e permitir aprofundamentos:\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **1. Conceito de Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs)**\n\n- NCCs são os correlatos neurais **mínimos suficientes** para que ocorra uma experiência consciente específica.\n- A definição de Chalmers busca evitar respostas triviais (como \"o cérebro inteiro\") ao exigir **suficiência mínima**, ou seja, o menor conjunto neural capaz de gerar aquela experiência.\n\n---\n\n### 🧬 **2. Vantagens do termo \"correlato\"**\n\n- Permite investigação empírica mesmo sem resolver o problema mente-corpo.\n- É metodologicamente viável: mensura correlações estatísticas, sem exigir compromissos com identidade, redução ou substratos.\n- Admite compatibilidade com visões dualistas, monistas e até paralelistas (ex: Leibniz).\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **3. Problemas Conceituais e Metodológicos**\nFink destaca questões que ainda desafiam a pesquisa:\n\n- Como distinguir correlatos estatísticos triviais de *correlatos fundamentais*?\n- Como separar os NCCs de condições necessárias, facilitadoras ou epifenômenos?\n- Como lidar com a subjetividade da consciência nas medidas empíricas?\n\n---\n\n### 📚 **4. Destaques dos artigos do volume**\n\n1. **Bachmann, Suzuki & Aru** – *Dendritic Integration Theory*  \n   Foca nos neurônios L5p como ponto-chave entre processos corticais e talâmicos.\n\n2. **Hohwy & Seth** – *Predictive Processing*  \n   Propõem usar processamento preditivo como estrutura unificadora para comparar teorias de consciência.\n\n3. **Klein, Bayne & Hohwy** – *Difference Makers of Consciousness*  \n   Criticam a busca por NCCs e propõem um modelo causal mais refinado: *DMCs* (fatores diferenciais da consciência).\n\n4. **Marvan & Polák** – *gNCC e NCc*  \n   Distinguem entre mecanismos gerais da consciência (gNCC) e mecanismos específicos de conteúdo (NCc).\n\n5. **Mazor & Fleming** – *Ausência vs. Consciência de Ausência*  \n   Argumentam por uma matriz bidimensional de relatórios para refinar a análise contrastiva.\n\n6. **McKilliam** – *O que é um estado global de consciência?*  \n   Propõe uma definição baseada em \"capacidades\" em vez de estados ocorrentes.\n\n7. **Michel & Lau** – *Marcadores vs. Constituintes vs. Correlatos*  \n   Alertam contra confundir diferentes categorias neurais e criticam a Teoria da Informação Integrada quando interpretada como teoria forte.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **5. Conclusão do autor**\n\nFink propõe que, mesmo após três décadas, a pesquisa sobre NCCs continua produtiva, mas requer:\n- **Maior rigor conceitual**\n- **Testes mais sofisticados**\n- **Diálogo constante entre filosofia e neurociência**\n\n---\n\n### 👣 Próximo passo\nDeseja que aprofundemos algum dos tópicos, como a teoria dos neurônios L5p, o modelo de processamento preditivo, ou a crítica à IIT? Também posso ajudá-lo a relacionar esse conteúdo com seus estudos em Gurdjieff, neuroética, ou segurança computacional — caso deseje cruzar domínios.\n\nComo prefere seguir?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"16662718-b5ab-4e83-8d82-8a5fe7384edd","request_id":"946a9de6dafcf1de-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"16662718-b5ab-4e83-8d82-8a5fe7384edd","children":["aae5394a-45d9-408f-8df1-55c92f70eb10"]},"aae5394a-45d9-408f-8df1-55c92f70eb10":{"id":"aae5394a-45d9-408f-8df1-55c92f70eb10","message":{"id":"aae5394a-45d9-408f-8df1-55c92f70eb10","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748402612.09409,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["além de estudar o assunto preciso me aprofundar na lingua inglesa, podemos estudar paragrafo a paragrafo ?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"dictation":false,"request_id":"946aa2462da2f1de-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5c11bb47-00a6-4df5-96b3-52bd7b61149d","children":["aa3f9233-8a3c-4fd6-8088-e1d852d5d968"]},"aa3f9233-8a3c-4fd6-8088-e1d852d5d968":{"id":"aa3f9233-8a3c-4fd6-8088-e1d852d5d968","message":{"id":"aa3f9233-8a3c-4fd6-8088-e1d852d5d968","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748402612.538119,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Excelente decisão, Marcos!

O marco inicial mais reconhecido desse programa foi o artigo de 1990 escrito por dois grandes nomes: **Francis Crick**, um dos descobridores da estrutura do DNA, e **Christof Koch**, neurocientista conhecido pelas pesquisas sobre visão e consciência.\n\n---\n\nQuer seguir para o próximo parágrafo?

ninety.\"**\n\n---\n\n### 🎧 Análise da sua fala:\n\n#### ✅ **Pontos positivos:**\n- **Clareza geral muito boa**: As palavras foram reconhecidas com precisão, o que indica boa dicção.\n- **Ritmo constante**, com pausas naturais.\n- Você pronunciou corretamente termos técnicos como **“neural correlates”** e **“consciousness”**, que são difíceis até para falantes avançados.\n\n#### ⚠️ **Oportunidades de melhora:**\n1. **Entonação (intonation)**: A leitura pode soar mais natural se você variar um pouco a melodia da fala — por exemplo, subir um pouco no início da frase e descer no final.\n2. **Ênfase em nomes próprios**: “**Francis Crick**” e “**Christof Koch**” soaram um pouco misturados; sugeriria separar mais cada nome com leve pausa.\n3. **Palavra composta “Thirty years ago”**: O “thirty” pareceu sutil demais — pode dar mais projeção ao “th”.\n\n---\n\n### 🗣️ Sugestão de prática:\nGrave novamente esse mesmo parágrafo com foco em:\n- **Entonação expressiva**\n- Separação clara de nomes próprios\n- Projeção das palavras com “th” e “r”\n\nSe quiser, posso fornecer um áudio com a pronúncia de referência para você imitar.

Vamos continuar o estudo do artigo **\"A Double Anniversary for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness\"** com o **segundo parágrafo**.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 **Parágrafo 2 – Texto original (inglês)**\n\n> The notion of a neural correlate of consciousness itself was around before their seminal paper. Crick and Koch, for example, cite Logothetis and Schall’s *Neuronal correlates of subjective visual perception* (1989), which arguably points in the same direction. That paper reports of single neuron recordings of the subjective perception of movement. It is therefore far less ambitious than Crick and Koch’s, which asks generally about the where, when, how, and why of neural activation correlating with consciousness.\n\n---\n\n## 🇧🇷 **Tradução comentada**\n\n> A noção de um **correlato neural da consciência** já existia antes do artigo seminal de Crick e Koch.  \n> Eles, por exemplo, citam o trabalho de Logothetis e Schall intitulado *“Correlatos neuronais da percepção visual subjetiva”* (1989), que, pode-se argumentar, aponta na mesma direção.  \n> Esse artigo relata **registros de neurônios individuais durante a percepção subjetiva de movimento**.  \n> Portanto, ele é muito **menos ambicioso** do que o de Crick e Koch, que pergunta de forma mais geral **onde, quando, como e por que** a ativação neural se correlaciona com a consciência.\n\n---\n\n### 🧾 Vocabulário e expressões-chave:\n\n| Termo / Expressão                     | Significado em português                            |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **notion**                           | noção                                               |\n| **seminal paper**                    | artigo seminal (altamente influente)                |\n| **cite**                             | citar                                                |\n| **arguably**                         | pode-se argumentar que                              |\n| **single neuron recordings**         | registros de neurônios individuais                  |\n| **subjective perception of movement**| percepção subjetiva de movimento                    |\n| **far less ambitious**               | muito menos ambicioso                               |\n| **asks generally about the where...**| questiona de forma geral sobre onde, quando, etc.   |\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Análise conceitual\n\nEste parágrafo destaca que a ideia de **correlação entre cérebro e consciência** não surgiu com Crick e Koch, mas que eles foram responsáveis por **dar amplitude e foco científico ao programa de investigação**. O artigo de Logothetis e Schall era mais restrito: observava a relação entre **percepções visuais específicas e a atividade de neurônios individuais** — um recorte mais limitado, mas ainda relevante.\n\nCrick e Koch, por outro lado, lançaram uma investigação **mais filosófica e abrangente**, perguntando:\n- **Onde** ocorrem essas correlações?\n- **Quando** elas surgem?\n- **Como** se estabelecem?\n- **Por que** se associam à experiência consciente?\n\n---\n\n### 🎧 Quer repetir o exercício?\n\nSe quiser:\n- Você pode gravar sua leitura deste parágrafo\n- Posso gerar o áudio com voz nativa para você praticar\n\nComo prefere seguir: leitura sua, voz de referência, ou já passamos para o próximo parágrafo?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"56ece841-81fb-48f1-a92c-ea62e7a53f92","request_id":"9472ca1b1c01f1d1-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"56ece841-81fb-48f1-a92c-ea62e7a53f92","children":["0d9b2326-9c3a-48cf-9346-8b01774156e9"]},"0d9b2326-9c3a-48cf-9346-8b01774156e9":{"id":"0d9b2326-9c3a-48cf-9346-8b01774156e9","message":{"id":"0d9b2326-9c3a-48cf-9346-8b01774156e9","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748488485.062634,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["gostaria de deixar a sugestão para os engenheiros de software da open IA de possibilitar a gravaçao de audio no botão +, como é o cado de fotos e poder receber gravaçoes de voz como retorno "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"dictation":false,"request_id":"9472d2c95a9ef183-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e5609825-9bd8-44b8-bda1-49a1c2755b89","children":["179aa178-e344-4bed-a0cb-dad071409f8d"]},"179aa178-e344-4bed-a0cb-dad071409f8d":{"id":"179aa178-e344-4bed-a0cb-dad071409f8d","message":{"id":"179aa178-e344-4bed-a0cb-dad071409f8d","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1748488485.919162,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sua sugestão é excelente, Marcos — e extremamente pertinente.\n\n### ✅ Sugestão resumida:\n> **Adicionar suporte nativo à gravação de voz diretamente pelo botão \"+\" no ChatGPT**, assim como já é possível enviar imagens.

Vamos estruturar sua ideia e conectá-la com o paper de forma que você possa apresentar isso ao professor Walter Chesnut com clareza e impacto.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 **Sua reflexão, em essência:**\n1. O **pensamento consciente** é uma das manifestações do sistema nervoso.\n2. Esse pensamento é **sequencial** e **efêmero** — temos um foco por vez.\n3. Estados de consciência variam e podem ser:\n   - autorreferenciais (foco em si mesmo)\n   - intersubjetivos (outros)\n   - naturais (mundo)\n   - espirituais (transcendentes)\n4. A atenção voluntária e a duração do pensamento são **limitadas**, exceto em estados de altíssima concentração.\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 **Relação com o artigo:**\n\nO artigo “A Double Anniversary for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness” (Fink, 2020) traz vários pontos que **dialogam com sua reflexão**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **A consciência como variável experimental limitada no tempo**\n> > \"*The goal is to see which neural variables co-vary with it.*\" (Fink, p.2)\n\nVocê está descrevendo, com base na experiência pessoal, **a limitação temporal da consciência**: não conseguimos manter livremente um único conteúdo mental por muito tempo. Isso se encaixa na **dificuldade metodológica de capturar a consciência como uma variável estável** — algo que o artigo aponta como um dos desafios do programa NCC.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Foco único e flutuação da consciência**\n> > \"*How many different core NCCs should we expect for a given conscious state?*\" (p.3)\n\nSua observação de que só conseguimos ter **um pensamento por vez** levanta uma questão crucial: será que os correlatos neurais funcionam em *blocos distintos* e sucessivos? Isso desafia modelos que tratam a consciência como um fluxo contínuo e estável.\n\nVocê pode propor uma pergunta ao grupo:\n> Será que há uma alternância cíclica de padrões neurais mínimos — uma espécie de “ping” entre focos diferentes — que produz essa sensação de sequência mental?\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Níveis e conteúdos da consciência**\n> Marvan e Polák propõem distinguir entre:\n- gNCC (correlato geral do estado consciente)\n- NCc (correlato do conteúdo específico)\n\nSua descrição de que a consciência pode se voltar ao eu, aos outros, à natureza ou ao espiritual se alinha perfeitamente com **diferentes conteúdos da consciência (NCc)**. E o estado de concentração extrema (como o cirurgião) pode ser lido como uma modulação do **gNCC**, ou seja, o estado global que regula a capacidade de sustentar o foco.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Proposta de formulação para o seu estudo**:\n\n> “O artigo destaca a busca por padrões neurais mínimos que sustentem a consciência, mas me pergunto: será que a própria limitação que temos em manter um único pensamento por mais de alguns segundos não é uma evidência de que a consciência está mais para uma *intermitência coordenada* do que para um estado contínuo? Talvez os NCCs não sejam uma estrutura fixa, mas um ritmo, um intervalo dinâmico entre foco, flutuação e realinhamento.”\n\n---\n\nSe quiser, posso organizar isso como um **roteiro curto para sua fala**, ou como **slides conceituais** caso vá apresentar.

Introspective Reflection: The Ephemeral Nature of Thought\\nThe human nervous system is responsible for a wide range of activities, many of which occur unconsciously. Among conscious activities, thought stands out, manifested through external actions or internal psychological reactions. When we focus specifically on the activity of thought, we observe that consciousness behaves in a sequential and fleeting manner:\\n\\n- A conscious thought tends to present itself in isolation (single focus)\\n- Its duration is brief, with difficulty in sustaining it for more than a few seconds\\n- This limitation can be temporarily overcome in states of high concentration, such as during surgery or in deep meditation\\n\\nThis empirical and subjective observation leads us to question whether the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) are also structured in an intermittent and rhythmic way, rather than stable and continuous.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Connections with Fink's Article (2020)\\n\\n#### 3.1 Consciousness as a transient empirical variable\\n> \\\"The goal is to see which neural variables co-vary with it.\\\" (Fink, p.2)\\n\\nThe difficulty in maintaining a single mental content for long periods reflects the inherent instability of consciousness as an empirical object.

Introduction\nThis document aims to establish a starting point for discussion based on the article *\"A Double Anniversary for the Neural Correlates of Consciousness\"* (Fink, 2020), integrating a recurring introspective reflection on the ephemeral and sequential nature of conscious thought.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Introspective Reflection: The Ephemeral Nature of Thought\nThe human nervous system is responsible for a wide range of activities, many of which occur unconsciously. Among conscious activities, thought stands out, manifested through external actions or internal psychological reactions. When we focus specifically on the activity of thought, we observe that consciousness behaves in a sequential and fleeting manner:\n\n- A conscious thought tends to present itself in isolation (single focus)\n- Its duration is brief, with difficulty in sustaining it for more than a few seconds\n- This limitation can be temporarily overcome in states of high concentration, such as during surgery or in deep meditation\n\nThis empirical and subjective observation leads us to question whether the neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) are also structured in an intermittent and rhythmic way, rather than stable and continuous.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Connections with Key Literature\n\n#### 3.1 Consciousness as a transient empirical variable\n> \"The goal is to see which neural variables co-vary with it.\" (Fink, 2020, p.2)\n\nThe difficulty in maintaining a single mental content for long periods reflects the inherent instability of consciousness as an empirical object. The article acknowledges this challenge by treating consciousness as a variable in search of neural co-variation.\n\n#### 3.2 Attentional fluctuation and single focus\n> \"How many different core NCCs should we expect for a given conscious state?\" (Fink, 2020, p.3)\n\nThe idea that we can only sustain one thought at a time implies that NCCs may operate in successive cycles, as a sequence of coordinated activations. This challenges models that treat consciousness as a stable stream and suggests a more rhythmic and modulated architecture.\n\n#### 3.3 Global states and specific contents\n> Marvan & Polák (2020): distinction between gNCC (general correlate) and NCc (content correlate)\n\nThe reflection proposes that consciousness can be directed toward different domains (self-reference, intersubjectivity, nature, spirituality). These domains may be represented by different NCc over a global state (gNCC) that defines the structure of consciousness at the moment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hypothesis for Discussion\n> \"Could neural correlates of consciousness function as a process of coordinated intermittency rather than a continuous state?\"\n\nThis hypothesis opens a path for investigating whether the brain's architecture favors a sequence of focused neural activations, with rapid transitions modulated by content and context. Such rhythm may be analogous to \"attention pulses\" or \"dynamic windows\" that sustain the continuity of conscious experience even with transient contents.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Next Steps\n- Present this hypothesis for discussion with Professor Walter Chesnut during the meeting on 05/28/2025\n- Investigate literature on dynamic models of consciousness (e.g., oscillatory synchronization, temporal integration theory)\n- Evaluate whether empirical studies have explored the relationship between thought duration and neural activation patterns\n\n---\n\n### References (ABNT Style)\n\nCHALMERS, David J.
