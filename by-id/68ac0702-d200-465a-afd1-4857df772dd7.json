A blockchain is essentially a record of digital events. However, it is not ‘‘just a record,’’ since it can also contain socalled smart contracts, which are programs stored on the blockchain that run as implemented without any risk of downtime, censorship, or fraud (Buterin 2014). While blockchain is now seen mostly as the technology enabling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it will most likely become an even more valuable enabler of economic and social transactions, for instance as a general purpose digital asset ownership record (Lindman et al. 2017). This is because the distributed transaction data and cryptographic logic that lies at the blockchain’s core make it extraordinarily tamper-resistant. The implications of creating a reliable, trustworthy distributed record system, or ledger, may be fundamental to how we organize interpersonal and interorganizational relationships. The global economic system depends on that individuals and organizations trust other entities to create, store, and distribute essential records. For example, banks construct and maintain the financial records, hospitals construct and maintain health records, and universities construct and maintain education records. Often, records central to our health, social, or professional lives are key records either constructed or maintained by third parties. Such third-party record repositories can be vulnerable to corruption by failure in storage systems or human mischief, which could be mitigated by unbiased and incorruptible blockchain-based digital systems (Nærland et al. 2017). The financial sector leads the way in developing blockchain applications and business models; but also companies in industries from shipping and transportation to healthcare and entertainment are actively using blockchain applications to coordinate the movement of products, facilitate the creation of e-health records, and to securely manage original entertainment content. While substantial activity exists in practice, less academic research has examined the implications of blockchain for how we organize contemporary economies, society or organizations. In this special issue, we present early research results that investigate the positive implications of blockchain for modern organizations, specifically in the financial services industry or to manage physical asset ownership. However, the range of potential blockchain applications goes further to cover a multitude of business and social arrangements from tracking shipping containers and pharmaceuticals to recording gambling winnings and marriages based on smart contracts embedded in blockchain applications.

The Blockchain was first used as a Peer-to-Peer ledger for registering Bitcoin transactions. The blockchain is a singly linked list which consists of a number of transactions. The blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger which consists of a number of blocks organized in the form of a chain. A block in blockchain consists of two parts data and hash pointer. The first block in the blockchain is known as genesis block. The transactions and data in the block are secured by cryptography. The data inside a block in blockchain can be anything like bank transactions, backup data etc., which are recorded chronologically and publicly. The Hash pointer of a block is a unique code generated by a hash function like SHA256, SHA-3 etc., the hash function used in bitcoin blockchain. A block consists of a public key and a private key, using hash function digital signature is generated to the block. This is how the data inside the blockchain is so secured. The blocks are added into the blockchain by verifying the transaction in the block, the transactions are verified by miners.

These use cases could see the impact of implementing blockchain in banking.\",\"paper_authors\":[\"Nurul Hidayah Arrifin\",\"Ulaganathan Subramanian\"],\"paper_publish_year\":2022,\"publication_journal_name\":\"2022 International Conference on Information Technology Systems and Innovation (ICITSI)\",\"consensus_paper_details_url\":\"https://consensus.app/papers/blockchain-banking-arrifin/40f438ecede650db8a48c3a44101a52e/?utm_source=chatgpt\",\"doi\":\"10.1109/ICITSI56531.2022.9970827\",\"volume\":\"\",\"pages\":\"58-63\",\"search_result_number\":19},{\"paper_title\":\"Blockchain technology, bitcoin, and Ethereum: A brief overview\",\"abstract\":\"The blockchain technology is a relatively new approach in the field of information technologies.

É uma tecnologia sobre a qual o processamento de dados pessoais pode depender, mas não é uma operação de processamento de dados com seu próprio propósito. As características centrais da blockchain incluem segurança, anonimato e integridade de dados sem a necessidade de uma organização terceirizada no controle das transações, o que cria áreas de pesquisa interessantes, especialmente do ponto de vista de desafios e limitações técnicas [(Nofer et al., 2020)](https://consensus.app/papers/blockchain-nofer/1f6110ab9ebc5d149117c6d2d0ba9e4b/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n- **Implementações e Aplicações**: Blockchain é uma tecnologia de ledger distribuído na forma de uma base de dados transacional distribuída, segura por criptografia e governada por um mecanismo de consenso. Embora atualmente seja mais vista como a tecnologia que habilita criptomoedas como o Bitcoin, provavelmente se tornará um habilitador ainda mais valioso de transações econômicas e sociais. Isso inclui servir como um registro digital de propriedade de ativos de uso geral. As implicações de criar um sistema de registro distribuído e confiável podem ser fundamentais para como organizamos relações interpessoais e interorganizacionais [(Beck et al., 2017)](https://consensus.app/papers/blockchain-technology-business-information-systems-beck/b294f1a8daba5e2f9e52e05125edc6c1/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n- **Desafios e Direções Futuras**: A maior parte da pesquisa se concentra no sistema Bitcoin, com menos de 20% abordando outras aplicações da blockchain, incluindo contratos inteligentes e licenciamento. A maioria das pesquisas visa revelar e melhorar as limitações da blockchain do ponto de vista da privacidade e segurança, embora muitas das soluções propostas careçam de avaliação concreta sobre sua eficácia. Desafios relacionados à escalabilidade da blockchain, incluindo throughput e latência, permanecem inexplorados. Com base neste estudo, são fornecidas recomendações sobre direções futuras de pesquisa para pesquisadores [(Yli-Huumo et al., 2016)](https://consensus.app/papers/where-current-research-blockchain-technology—a-ylihuumo/1d54899b4d675f53914e4e27ba137729/?utm_source=chatgpt).\n\n**Conclusão**: A tecnologia blockchain representa uma inovação significativa no campo da ciência da computação, oferecendo uma estrutura matemática para armazenamento seguro e descentralizado de transações digitais. Seu potencial vai além das criptomoedas, prometendo transformar diversas áreas, como bancos, saúde, transporte, fabricação, cadeia de suprimentos e educação, por meio da criação de um sistema de registro distribuído e confiável. Contudo, a realização plena de seu potencial ainda enfrenta desafios significativos, particularmente em termos de escalabilidade, privacidade e segurança.\n\nGostaria de mais detalhes sobre um aspecto específico da tecnologia blockchain? \n\nLike our GPT?
