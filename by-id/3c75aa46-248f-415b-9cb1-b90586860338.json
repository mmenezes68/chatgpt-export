The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system). They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

O artigo argumenta que esses LLMs podem processar textos com sucesso extraordinário e muitas vezes de maneira indistinguível da produção humana, embora faltem inteligência, compreensão ou habilidade cognitiva. Também destaca as limitações desses LLMs, como sua fragilidade (susceptibilidade a falhas catastróficas), falta de confiabilidade (informações falsas ou inventadas) e a ocasional incapacidade de fazer inferências lógicas elementares ou lidar com matemática simples. O artigo conclui que os LLMs representam uma dissociação entre agência e inteligência. Embora extremamente poderosos e potencialmente muito úteis, eles não devem ser usados para raciocínio complexo ou informações cruciais, mas podem ser usados para obter uma compreensão mais profunda do conteúdo e do contexto de um texto, em vez de substituir a entrada humana. O melhor autor não é nem um LLM nem um ser humano, mas um ser humano usando um LLM de forma proficiente e perspicaz.\n\n**Palavras-chave:** Inteligência Artificial (IA), Grandes Modelos de Linguagem (LLMs), GPT-3, ChatGPT, Limitações.\n\n**Isenção de responsabilidade do LLM:** este manuscrito foi escrito usando a versão de 30 de janeiro do ChatGPT para gerar as três figuras.\n```\n\nPode me avisar quando estiver pronto para continuar com a próxima página."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"5bfb6167-cc2a-4b59-a498-5c5e4d6c5df4","request_id":"8a13f07f8c0f7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"5bfb6167-cc2a-4b59-a498-5c5e4d6c5df4","children":["5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88"]},"5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88":{"id":"5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88","message":{"id":"5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650097.404208,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["continue "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8a13f2a058ce7df8-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"46f8ab6b-93cb-4e52-af39-ad84864e8789","children":["ec3d4920-2762-48c9-b971-49a372dc8150"]},"ec3d4920-2762-48c9-b971-49a372dc8150":{"id":"ec3d4920-2762-48c9-b971-49a372dc8150","message":{"id":"ec3d4920-2762-48c9-b971-49a372dc8150","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650112.672857,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"# Open the PDF file again\npdf_file = open(pdf_path, \"rb\")\n\n# Create a PDF reader\npdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n\n# Extract the text from the second page\nsecond_page_text = pdf_reader.getPage(1).extract_text()\n\n# Close the PDF file\npdf_file.close()\n\nsecond_page_text"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200007]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88","request_id":"8a13f2a058ce7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"5254dcd5-a414-4082-9eec-f49c82ba0a88","children":["6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638"]},"6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638":{"id":"6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638","message":{"id":"6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638","author":{"role":"tool","name":"python","metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650112.672915,"update_time":1720650101.2506418,"content":{"content_type":"execution_output","text":"'The first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dicti\\nonary, the difference is made  \\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentenc es \\n\\n(Borges 2000).

A segunda ideia é antiga: todas as palavras no dicionário estão presentes no alfabeto, a diferença é feita pela morfologia, ou seja, pela forma como as letras do alfabeto são estruturadas em palavras (Clarke 1967). A terceira ideia é antiga: todas as letras estão presentes no código digital, a diferença é feita pela forma como as sequências finitas de zeros e uns do código digital são estruturadas em letras (Lodder 2008). A quarta ideia também é antiga: todas as sequências de zeros e uns estão presentes em duas propriedades eletromagnéticas, corrente alta ou baixa, magnetização presente ou ausente, a diferença é feita pela forma como essas propriedades podem ser manipuladas por dispositivos computacionais eletrônicos (Mano 1979). Mas a quinta ideia é revolucionária: hoje, a inteligência artificial (IA) gerencia as propriedades do eletromagnetismo para processar textos com sucesso extraordinário e muitas vezes de uma maneira que é indistinguível de como os seres humanos seriam capazes de fazê-lo. Estes são os chamados grandes modelos de linguagem (LLMs), e eles estão causando sensação.\n\nOs LLMs mais famosos são GPT-3, ChatGPT (também conhecido como GPT-3.5, produzido pela OpenAI-Microsoft) e Bard (produzido pelo Google). Eles não raciocinam ou entendem, não são um passo em direção a nenhuma IA de ficção científica, e não têm nada a ver com os processos cognitivos presentes no mundo animal, e acima de tudo, no cérebro e na mente humana, para gerenciar conteúdos semânticos com sucesso (Bishop 2021). No entanto, com o crescimento impressionante dos dados disponíveis, quantidade e velocidade de cálculo, e algoritmos cada vez melhores, eles podem fazer estatisticamente – ou seja, trabalhando na estrutura formal, e não no significado dos textos que lidam – o que fazemos semanticamente, mesmo que de maneiras que ainda estão sendo exploradas pela neurociência. Suas habilidades são extraordinárias, como até mesmo os mais céticos devem admitir.\n```\n\nPor favor, me avise quando estiver pronto para continuar com a próxima página."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8a13f2a058ce7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6cb9ce7a-432d-4d95-9392-55761e2a9638","children":["003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468"]},"003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468":{"id":"003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468","message":{"id":"003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650130.912457,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["continue"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8a13f37439fb7df8-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"649cc20e-121d-46bf-805b-e1b7c93309d0","children":["44ffa52b-7b01-461e-80a9-1523848dfa34"]},"44ffa52b-7b01-461e-80a9-1523848dfa34":{"id":"44ffa52b-7b01-461e-80a9-1523848dfa34","message":{"id":"44ffa52b-7b01-461e-80a9-1523848dfa34","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650143.991947,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"# Open the PDF file again\npdf_file = open(pdf_path, \"rb\")\n\n# Create a PDF reader\npdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n\n# Extract the text from the third page\nthird_page_text = pdf_reader.getPage(2).extract_text()\n\n# Close the PDF file\npdf_file.close()\n\nthird_page_text"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200007]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8a13f37439fb7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"003e8738-f57a-45fa-83f9-fa91a98b4468","children":["573f631a-df12-4774-b728-f669aaae7907"]},"573f631a-df12-4774-b728-f669aaae7907":{"id":"573f631a-df12-4774-b728-f669aaae7907","message":{"id":"573f631a-df12-4774-b728-f669aaae7907","author":{"role":"tool","name":"python","metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650143.992011,"update_time":1720650135.4898312,"content":{"content_type":"execution_output","text":"'on the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they dea l w\\nith \\n wha t \\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neurosc ience. \\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptic al must\\n admit. \\nHere is a summary of \\nThe Divine Comedy\\n made by ChatGPT. \\n \\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version.

Se eu fosse o Google, não apostaria as fortunas da minha empresa em um mecanismo tão frágil. \n\nDado o enorme sucesso e as igualmente amplas limitações, alguns compararam os LLMs a papagaios estocásticos que repetem textos sem entender nada (Bender et al. 2021). A analogia ajuda, mas apenas parcialmente, não só porque os papagaios têm uma inteligência própria que seria a inveja de qualquer IA, mas, acima de tudo, porque os LLMs sintetizam textos de novas maneiras, reestruturando os conteúdos nos quais foram treinados, não fornecendo repetições simples ou justaposições. Eles se parecem muito mais com a função de autocompletar de um motor de busca. E, em sua capacidade de síntese, eles se aproximam daqueles estudantes medíocres ou preguiçosos que, para escrever um ensaio curto, usam uma dúzia de referências relevantes sugeridas pelo professor e, pegando um pouco aqui e um pouco ali, montam um texto eclético, coerente, mas sem ter entendido muito ou acrescentado algo.\n\nComo tutor universitário em Oxford, corrigi muitos deles a cada semestre. Eles agora podem ser produzidos mais rapidamente e eficientemente pelo ChatGPT. \n\nInfelizmente, a melhor analogia que conheço para descrever ferramentas como o ChatGPT é culturalmente limitada, e refere-se a um grande clássico da literatura italiana, *Os Noivos* (Manzoni 2016). Em uma cena famosa em que Renzo (um dos personagens principais) encontra um advogado, lemos: \"Enquanto o doutor [o advogado] pronunciava todas essas palavras, Renzo olhava para ele com atenção extasiada, como uma pessoa crédula [materialone] fica na praça olhando para o trapaceiro [giocatore di bussolotti], que, depois de enfiar estopa e estopa e estopa na boca, tira fita e fita e fita, que nunca acaba\".\n```\n\nPor favor, me avise quando estiver pronto para continuar com a próxima página."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAA","parent_id":"d6788137-b3df-4765-8f9c-5e42c9194b77","request_id":"8a13f6fa4a2c7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d6788137-b3df-4765-8f9c-5e42c9194b77","children":["c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b"]},"c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b":{"id":"c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b","message":{"id":"c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650364.045237,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["continue"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8a13f9255b5e7df8-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"36a61866-14bc-442d-9460-01d632796e81","children":["2d8341b4-7b7f-4b6b-a0db-650da5eeddd6"]},"2d8341b4-7b7f-4b6b-a0db-650da5eeddd6":{"id":"2d8341b4-7b7f-4b6b-a0db-650da5eeddd6","message":{"id":"2d8341b4-7b7f-4b6b-a0db-650da5eeddd6","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650379.044304,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"code","language":"unknown","response_format_name":null,"text":"# Open the PDF file again\npdf_file = open(pdf_path, \"rb\")\n\n# Create a PDF reader\npdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdf_file)\n\n# Extract the text from the seventh page\nseventh_page_text = pdf_reader.getPage(6).extract_text()\n\n# Close the PDF file\npdf_file.close()\n\nseventh_page_text"},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200007]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b","request_id":"8a13f9255b5e7df8-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"python","channel":null},"parent":"c2f28f5a-808d-47a4-aede-7035ac2eb00b","children":["484ba931-48c6-4b10-9bb7-7306a00e0534"]},"484ba931-48c6-4b10-9bb7-7306a00e0534":{"id":"484ba931-48c6-4b10-9bb7-7306a00e0534","message":{"id":"484ba931-48c6-4b10-9bb7-7306a00e0534","author":{"role":"tool","name":"python","metadata":{}},"create_time":1720650379.044391,"update_time":1720650368.5771306,"content":{"content_type":"execution_output","text":"'\\n\\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]\\n.

Se precisarmos da \"fita\" de suas informações, é bom prestar muita atenção em como foi produzida, por que e com que impacto. E aqui chegamos a coisas mais interessantes.\n\nO impacto dos LLMs e dos vários sistemas de IA que produzem conteúdo de todos os tipos hoje será enorme. Basta pensar no DALL-E, que, como o ChatGPT diz (cito sem qualquer modificação), \"é um sistema de inteligência artificial desenvolvido pela OpenAI que gera imagens originais a partir de descrições textuais. Ele usa técnicas de aprendizado de máquina de ponta para produzir imagens de alta qualidade que correspondem ao texto de entrada, incluindo legendas, palavras-chave e até mesmo frases simples. Com o DALL-E, os usuários podem inserir uma descrição textual da imagem que desejam, e o sistema produzirá uma imagem que corresponda à descrição.\" Existem questões éticas e legais: basta pensar nos direitos autorais e nos direitos de reprodução vinculados às fontes de dados nos quais a IA em questão foi treinada. Os primeiros processos já começaram, e já houve os primeiros escândalos de plágio. Existem custos humanos: considere o uso de contratados no Quênia, pagos menos de $2/hora para rotular conteúdo prejudicial para treinar o ChatGPT; eles não conseguiram acessar recursos adequados de saúde mental, e muitos ficaram traumatizados. Existem problemas humanos, como o impacto nos professores que precisam se esforçar para reformular seu currículo, ou\n\nFontes:\n5.

É uma forma de agência que é alienígena a qualquer cultura de qualquer passado, porque a humanidade sempre e em todos os lugares viu esse tipo de agência – que não é a de uma onda do mar, que faz a diferença, mas não pode fazer nada além dessa diferença, sem ser capaz de \"aprender\" a fazer uma diferença diferente ou melhor – como uma forma de agência natural ou mesmo sobrenatural.\n\nPassamos de estar em contato constante com agentes animais e o que acreditávamos ser agentes espirituais (deuses e forças da natureza, anjos e demônios, almas ou fantasmas, espíritos bons e maus) para ter que entender e aprender a interagir com agentes artificiais criados por nós, como novos demiurgos de tal forma de agência.

No gnosticismo, o Demiurgo é frequentemente visto como uma divindade inferior que cria o mundo material, às vezes retratada como ignorante ou maligna, em contraste com um Deus supremo transcendente."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"235565d8-a601-42cc-bdeb-4ef6251b4123","request_id":"8a147051cb867dfb-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"235565d8-a601-42cc-bdeb-4ef6251b4123","children":["97bb7c9f-c425-4db7-a26d-a71de371c161"]},"97bb7c9f-c425-4db7-a26d-a71de371c161":{"id":"97bb7c9f-c425-4db7-a26d-a71de371c161","message":{"id":"97bb7c9f-c425-4db7-a26d-a71de371c161","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720655391.081919,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["eu farei anotaçoes dessa leitura e consideraçoes sobre a utilizaçao do chatgpt a partir da versao 3 e uso de Midjourney e mais recentetmente do Dalle mais atual na versao mais atual o GPT para o meu orientador, ok ?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8a1473df8b487dfb-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"88640a01-13d2-4726-9d06-cba0c0d2becb","children":["fb898e1a-4f02-4ce2-ac4f-11fbf21c6904"]},"fb898e1a-4f02-4ce2-ac4f-11fbf21c6904":{"id":"fb898e1a-4f02-4ce2-ac4f-11fbf21c6904","message":{"id":"fb898e1a-4f02-4ce2-ac4f-11fbf21c6904","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1720655405.292194,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Claro, Marcos!

The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system). They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

Usei-o desde a primeira vez como suporte ao meu estudo em Filosofia e Inteligência Artificial. Um dos principais problemas enfrentados foi a geração de frases atribuídas a obras inexistentes, conhecidas como \"alucinações\". Depois de entender essa dificuldade, passei a verificar todas as citações e referências.\n\nNa versão 3 do ChatGPT, não havia a possibilidade de gerar imagens, então recorri a outro software chamado Midjourney, também na versão paga, obtendo excelentes resultados com a compreensão da necessidade de gerar prompts bem elaborados para a produção de imagens.\n\nNesta última versão do GPT, também paga, muitos dos erros iniciais foram corrigidos, a qualidade do texto está melhor, mas há limitação do tamanho do texto e não há fórmula mágica para a produção do texto. A compreensão do assunto é fundamental para a construção dos prompts e os resultados dependem em grande parte da capacidade do operador. Como era de se esperar, o trabalho repetitivo e a pesquisa rápida ficam a cargo do sistema e, como exposto no artigo de Luciano Floridi, a combinação do homem e da máquina traz resultados impressionantes.\n\nFloridi argumenta que os grandes modelos de linguagem, como o ChatGPT, representam uma dissociação entre agência e inteligência, sendo extremamente poderosos e úteis, mas não devem ser confiados para raciocínio complexo ou informações cruciais【78†source】. Ele destaca que, embora esses modelos possam gerar textos de forma extraordinária, eles operam sem qualquer compreensão ou habilidade cognitiva real【78†source】. Além disso, Floridi aponta que esses modelos têm limitações significativas, como a suscetibilidade a falhas catastróficas e a criação de informações falsas【78†source】.\n\n---\n\nEspero que isso ajude a estruturar suas anotações.

The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system). They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system). They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system). They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

They make up texts, answers, or references when they do not know \n\nhow to answer; make obvious factual mistakes; sometimes fail to make the most \n\ntrivial logical inferences or struggle with simple mathematics4; or have strange \n\nlinguistic blind spots where they get stuck ( Floridi and Chiriatti 2020; Cobbe et al. \n\n2021; Perez et al. 2022; Arkoudas 2023; Borji 2023; Christian 2023; Rumbelow \n\n2023). A simple example in English illustrates well the limits of a mechanism that \n\nmanages texts without understanding anything of their content. When asked – using \n\nthe Saxon genitive – what is the name of Laura’s mother’s only daughter, the \n\nanswer is kindly idiotic: \n\n \n\nFigure 2 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 2. \n\n \n\n \n4 https://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/  \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/business/researchers-find-that-large-language-models-struggle-with-math/\n\n\nForget passing the Turing Test. Had I been Google, I would not have staked the \n\nfortunes of my company on such a brittle mechanism.  \n\nGiven the enormous successes and equally broad limitations, some have \n\ncompared LLMs to stochastic parrots that repeat texts without understanding \n\nanything (Bender et al. 2021). The analogy helps, but only partially, not only \n\nbecause parrots have an intelligence of their own that would be the envy of any AI \n\nbut, above all, because LLMs synthesise texts in new ways, restructuring the \n\ncontents on which they have been trained, not providing simple repetitions or \n\njuxtapositions. They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything. As a college tutor \n\nat Oxford, I corrected many of them every term. They can now be produced more \n\nquickly and efficiently by ChatGPT.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best analogy I know to describe tools such as ChatGPT \n\nis culturally bounded, and refers to a great classic in Italian literature, Manzoni’s \n\nThe Betrothed (Manzoni 2016). In a famous scene in which Renzo (one of the main \n\ncharacters) meets a lawyer, we read: “While the doctor [the lawyer] was uttering \n\nall these words, Renzo was looking at him with ecstatic attention, like a gullible \n\nperson [materialone] stands in the square looking at the trickster [giocator di \n\nbussolotti], which, after stuffing tow and tow and tow into its mouth, takes out tape \n\nand tape and tape, which never ends [the word “nastro” should be traduced more \n\n\n\ncorrectly as “ribbon”, but obviously “tape” is preferable in this context, for it \n\nreminds one of the endless tape of a Turing Machine]”. LLMs are like that trickster: \n\nthey gobble data in astronomical quantities and regurgitate information. If we need \n\nthe “tape” of their information, it is good to pay close attention to how it was \n\nproduced, why, and with what impact. And here we come to more interesting things. \n\nThe impact of LLMs and the various AI systems that produce content of all \n\nkinds today will be enormous. Just think of DALL-E, which, as ChatGPT says (I \n\nquote without any modification), “is an artificial intelligence system developed by \n\nOpenAI that generates original images starting from textual descriptions. It uses \n\nstate-of-the-art machine learning techniques to produce high-quality images that \n\nmatch input text, including captions, keywords, and even simple sentences. With \n\nDALL-E, users can enter a text description of the image they want, and the system \n\nwill produce an image that matches the description.” There are ethical and legal \n\nissues: just think of copyright and the re-production rights linked to the data sources \n\non which the AI in question is trained. The first lawsuits have already begun,5 and \n\nthere have already been the first plagiarism scandals.6 There are human costs: \n\nconsider the use of contractors in Kenya, paid less than $2/hour to label harmful \n\ncontent to train ChatGPT; they were unable to access adequate mental health \n\nresources, and many have been left traumatized.7 There are human problems, like \n\nthe impact on teachers who have to scramble to revamp their curriculum,8 or \n\n \n5 https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-\ntech  \n6 https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/  \n7 https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/  \n8 https://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/first-ai-art-generator-lawsuits-threaten-future-of-emerging-tech\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2023/01/17/cnet-ai-articles-journalism-corrections/\nhttps://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\nhttps://ethicalreckoner.substack.com/p/er13-on-community-chatgpt-and-human\n\n\nsecurity considerations, for example, concerning the outputs of AI processes that \n\nare increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, with implications of \n\nalgorithmic poisoning of the AI’s training data. Or think of the financial and \n\nenvironmental costs of these new systems (Cowls et al. 2021): is such type of \n\ninnovation fair and sustainable? Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it.

They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021).

That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance.

Then there are questions related to the best use of \n\nthese tools, at school, at work, in research environments and for scientific \n\npublications, in the automatic production of code, or the generation of content in \n\ncontexts such as customer service, or in the drafting of any text, including scientific \n\narticles or new legislation. Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.

The article \nargues that these LLMs can process texts with extraordinary success and often in a \nway that is indistinguishable from human output, while lacking any intelligence, \nunderstanding or cognitive ability. It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, \nsuch as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false \nor made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical \ninferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, \nrepresent a decoupling of agency and intelligence. While extremely powerful and \npotentially very useful, they should not be relied upon for complex reasoning or \ncrucial information, but could be used to gain a deeper understanding of a text’s \ncontent and context, rather than as a replacement for human input. The best author \nis neither an LLM nor a human being, but a human being using an LLM proficiently \nand insightfully. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT3, \nChatGPT, Limitations. \n \nLLM Disclaimer: this manuscript has been written using ChatGPT Jan 30 Version \nto generate the three Figures.  \n\nmailto:luciano.floridi@oii.ox.ac.uk\n\n\nThe first idea is old: all the texts are present in the dictionary, the difference is made \n\nby the syntax, that is, by how the dictionary words are structured into sentences \n\n(Borges 2000). The second idea is old: all the words in the dictionary are present in \n\nthe alphabet, the difference is made by morphology, that is, by how the letters of \n\nthe alphabet are structured into words (Clarke 1967). The third idea is old: all the \n\nletters are present in the digital code, the difference is made by how the finite strings \n\nof zeros and ones of the digital code are structured into letters (Lodder 2008). The \n\nfourth idea is also old: all strings of zeros and ones are present in two \n\nelectromagnetic properties, current high or low, magnetisation present or absent, \n\nthe difference is made by how such properties can be handled by electronic \n\ncomputational devices (Mano 1979). But the fifth idea is revolutionary: today, \n\nartificial intelligence (AI) manages the properties of electromagnetism to process \n\ntexts with extraordinary success and often in a way that is indistinguishable from \n\nhow human beings would be able to do it. These are the so-called large language \n\nmodels (LLMs), and they are rightly causing a sensation.  \n\nThe most famous LLMs are GPT3, ChatGPT (also known as GPT3.5, \n\nproduced by OpenAI-Microsoft) and Bard1 (produced by Google). They do not \n\nreason or understand, they are not a step towards any sci-fi AI, and they have \n\nnothing to do with the cognitive processes present in the animal world, and above \n\nall, in the human brain and mind, to manage semantic contents successfully (Bishop \n\n2021). However, with the staggering growth of available data, quantity and speed \n\nof calculation, and ever-better algorithms, they can do statistically – that is, working \n\n \n1 To be precise, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is the Google language model, \nBard is the name of the service. \n\n\n\non the formal structure, and not on the meaning of the texts they deal with – what \n\nwe do semantically, even if in ways that are still being explored by neuroscience. \n\nTheir abilities are extraordinary, as even the most sceptical must admit. \n\nHere is a summary of The Divine Comedy made by ChatGPT. \n\n \n\nFigure 1 ChatGPT Jan 30 Version. Test 1. \n\n \n\nOne may criticize the summary because it is longer than 50 words, and because The \n\nDivine Comedy is not an epic poem – although there is a debate on this topic on the \n\nInternet, hence the ChatGPT summary – but rather a tragedy, as Dante himself \n\nsuggested. That said, the summary is not bad, and certainly better than one produced \n\nby a mediocre student. The exercise is no longer to make summaries without using \n\nChatGPT, but to teach how to use the right prompts (the question or request that \n\ngenerates the text, see the first line of my request), check the result, know what to \n\ncorrect in the text produced by ChatGPT, discover that there is a debate on which \n\nliterary genre best applies to The Divine Comedy, and in the meantime, in doing all \n\nthis, learn many things not only about the software but above all about The Divine \n\nComedy itself. As I used to teach my students at Oxford in the 1990s, one of the \n\nbest exercises for writing an essay on Descartes’ Meditations is not to summarise \n\n\n\nwhat has already been said, but to take the electronic text of one of the Meditations \n\nand try to improve its translation into English (thus one learns to check the original); \n\nclarify the less clear passages with a more accessible paraphrase (thus one sees if \n\none has really understood the text); try to criticise or refine the arguments, \n\nmodifying or strengthening them (thus one realizes that others have tried to do the \n\nsame, and that is not so easy); and while doing all this learn the nature, internal \n\nstructure, dynamics and mechanisms of the content on which one is working. Or, \n\nto change the example, one really knows a topic not when one knows how to write \n\na Wikipedia entry about it – this can be done by ChatGPT increasingly well – but \n\nwhen one knows how to correct it. One should use the software as a tool to get \n\none’s hands on the text/mechanism, and get them dirty even by messing it up, as \n\nlong as one masters the nature and the logic of the artefact called text. \n\nThe limitations of these LLMs are now obvious even to the most \n\nenthusiastic. They are fragile, because when they do not work, they fail \n\ncatastrophically, in the etymological sense of vertical and immediate fall in the \n\nperformance. The Bard disaster, where it provided incorrect information in a \n\ndemonstration failure that cost Google over $100 billion in stock losses,2 is a good \n\nreminder that doing things with zero intelligence, whether digital or human, is \n\nsometimes very painful (Bing Chat also has its problems3). There is now a line of \n\nresearch that produces very sophisticated analyses on how, when, and why these \n\nLLMs, which seem incorrigible, have an unlimited number of Achilles heels (when \n\n \n2 https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-\ncompany-ad-2023-02-08/  \n3 https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-\ntechnology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/  \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\nhttps://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-spills-its-secrets-via-prompt-injection-attack/amp/\n\n\nasked what his Achilles heel is, ChatGPT correctly replied saying that it is just an \n\nAI system).

They look much more like the autocomplete function of a search \n\nengine. And in their capacity for synthesis, they approach those mediocre or lazy \n\nstudents who, to write a short essay, use a dozen relevant references suggested by \n\nthe teacher, and by taking a little here and a little there, put together an eclectic text, \n\ncoherent, but without having understood much or added anything.

Some jobs will disappear, others are already emerging, \n\nand many will have to be reconsidered.  \n\nBut above all, for a philosopher, there are many challenging questions \n\nabout: the emergence of LEGO-like AI systems, working together in a modular and \n\nseamless way, with LLMs acting as a AI2AI kind of bridge to make them \n\ninteroperable, as a sort of “confederated AI”;9 the relationship between form and its \n\nsyntax, and content and its semantics; the nature of personalisation of content  and \n\nthe fragmentation of shared experience (AI can easily produce a unique, single \n\nnovel on-demand, for a single reader, for example); the concept of interpretability, \n\nand the value of the process and the context of the production of meaning; our \n\nuniqueness and originality as producers of meaning and sense, and of new contents; \n\n \n9 I owe this remark to Vincent Wang who reminded me of two interesting examples (1) having \nChatGPT and Wolfram Alpha talk to each other; ChatGPT outsources mathematics questions to \nWolfram Alpha, which has considerable ability by itself to parse mathematical questions in natural \nlanguage format, see https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-\nbring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/; (2) “Socratic Models” for multimodal \ngrounding/reasoning, where the idea is to tag different forms of data e.g. sounds and images, with text \ndescriptions so that an LLM can serve as “central processing” allowing different narrow AIs to talk to \neach other. https://socraticmodels.github.io/. \n\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\nhttps://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/\n\n\nour ability to interact with systems that are increasingly indiscernible from other \n\nhuman beings; our replaceability as readers, interpreters, translators, synthesisers \n\nand evaluators of content; power as the control of questions, because, to paraphrase \n\n1984, whoever controls the questions controls the answers, and whoever controls \n\nthe answers controls reality;.  \n\nMore questions will emerge as we develop, interact, and learn to understand \n\nthis new form of agency. As Vincent Wang reminded me, ChatGPT leapfrogged \n\nGPT3 in performance by the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-\n\ntune its outputs as an interlocutor, and RL is the machine learning approach to \n\n“solving agency”. It is a form of agency never seen before, because it is successful \n\nand can “learn” and improve its behaviour without having to be intelligent in doing \n\nso. It is a form of agency that is alien to any culture in any past, because humanity \n\nhas always and everywhere seen this kind of agency – which is not that of a sea \n\nwave, which makes the difference, but can make nothing but that difference, \n\nwithout being able to “learn” to make a different or better difference – as a natural \n\nor even supernatural form of agency.  \n\nWe have gone from being in constant contact with animal agents and what \n\nwe believed to be spiritual agents (gods and forces of nature, angels and demons, \n\nsouls or ghosts, good and evil spirits) to having to understand, and learn to interact \n\nwith, artificial agents created by us, as new demiurges of such a form of agency. \n\nWe have decoupled the ability to act successfully from the need to be intelligent, \n\nunderstand, reflect, consider, or grasp anything. We have liberated agency from \n\nintelligence. So, I am not sure we may be “shepherds of Being” (Heidegger), but it \n\n\n\nlooks like the new “green collars” (Floridi 2017) will be “shepherds of AI systems”, \n\nin charge of this new form of artificial agency. \n\nThe agenda of a demiurgic humanity of this intelligence-free (as in fat-free) \n\nAI – understood as Agere sine Intelligere, with a bit of high school Latin – is yet to \n\nbe written. It may be alarming or exciting for many, but it is undoubtedly good \n\nnews for philosophers looking for work. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nI am very grateful for the insightful comments by Ben Bariach, Alexander \n\nBlanshard, Emmie Hine, Joshua Jaffe, Claudio Novelli, Mariarosaria Taddeo, and \n\nVincent Wang.
