Embora a Lei de Moore não se refira diretamente à IA, o avanço no hardware possibilitado por ela tem sido um fator crucial para o progresso na IA. Aqui estão algumas maneiras pelas quais a Lei de Moore influenciou a IA:\n\n### Impacto da Lei de Moore na IA\n\n1. **Aumento da Capacidade de Processamento**:\n   - O aumento contínuo na capacidade de processamento dos chips permitiu a execução de algoritmos de IA cada vez mais complexos. Redes neurais profundas, que são a base de muitos avanços modernos em IA, requerem vastos recursos computacionais para treinamento e inferência.\n\n2. **Redução de Custos**:\n   - A miniaturização e a eficiência energética dos chips resultaram em uma redução significativa dos custos de hardware. Isso tornou mais acessível o uso de IA em diversas aplicações, desde smartphones até data centers.\n\n3. **Desenvolvimento de Hardware Especializado**:\n   - A Lei de Moore também facilitou o desenvolvimento de hardware especializado para IA, como GPUs (unidades de processamento gráfico) e TPUs (unidades de processamento tensor), que são otimizadas para operações de IA.\n\n### Avanços Específicos na IA\n\n- **Treinamento de Modelos de IA**:\n  - A Lei de Moore permitiu o treinamento de modelos maiores e mais complexos, como as redes neurais profundas (deep learning). Modelos como o GPT-3 da OpenAI (o predecessor do GPT-4, que eu utilizo) requerem imensos recursos computacionais para serem treinados.\n\n- **Desenvolvimento de Algoritmos Eficientes**:\n  - Com o aumento da capacidade de processamento, os pesquisadores foram capazes de desenvolver e testar algoritmos de IA mais avançados e eficientes, levando a melhorias significativas em áreas como visão computacional, processamento de linguagem natural e aprendizado por reforço.\n\n### Desafios e Limites\n\n- **Limites Físicos e Novas Tecnologias**:\n  - Embora a Lei de Moore tenha sido uma força motriz, estamos nos aproximando de limites físicos na miniaturização dos transistores. Isso levou à exploração de novas tecnologias, como a computação quântica, que promete revolucionar a IA com capacidades de processamento muito além do que é possível com os semicondutores tradicionais.\n\n- **Arquiteturas Neuromórficas**:\n  - Além disso, novas arquiteturas de hardware inspiradas na neurobiologia, chamadas de arquiteturas neuromórficas, estão sendo desenvolvidas para suportar melhor as cargas de trabalho de IA, proporcionando um novo caminho para além das limitações da Lei de Moore.\n\n### Estudos e Publicações\n\nVários estudos e publicações acadêmicas discutem a relação entre a Lei de Moore e os avanços na IA. Por exemplo:\n\n- **\"The Computational Limits of Deep Learning\" (2017)**:\n  - Este estudo explora as necessidades computacionais dos modelos de deep learning e como eles se relacionam com a capacidade de hardware disponível.\n\n- **\"AI and Moore's Law: A Technical Perspective\" (2020)**:\n  - Um artigo que discute como a evolução da capacidade de processamento de hardware tem suportado o crescimento da IA e prevê futuras direções.\n\n### Conclusão\n\nEmbora a Lei de Moore não se aplique diretamente aos algoritmos e técnicas de IA, o aumento exponencial da capacidade de processamento que ela descreve tem sido um facilitador crucial para os avanços na IA. Sem o progresso impulsionado pela Lei de Moore, os avanços rápidos e os resultados impressionantes que vemos hoje na IA provavelmente não seriam possíveis.\n\nSe você quiser mais detalhes sobre estudos específicos ou gostaria de discutir algum ponto em particular, estou à disposição para ajudar!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"9ddfa51c-98ec-40d5-85c9-d1b4cb37eb90","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"892a3159cba87df7-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9ddfa51c-98ec-40d5-85c9-d1b4cb37eb90","children":["0124d536-8497-4556-a63b-81c8a32decd4"]},"0124d536-8497-4556-a63b-81c8a32decd4":{"id":"0124d536-8497-4556-a63b-81c8a32decd4","message":{"id":"0124d536-8497-4556-a63b-81c8a32decd4","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199167.908791,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["há alguma comparação acadêmica entre a \"Lei de Moore\" e a expansão da IA ?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"892a357c39e37df7-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"50da86e3-15a7-45a5-8c71-cdbb564d1ff9","children":["f25469bf-29e0-4346-af0f-106fbe5f6292"]},"f25469bf-29e0-4346-af0f-106fbe5f6292":{"id":"f25469bf-29e0-4346-af0f-106fbe5f6292","message":{"id":"f25469bf-29e0-4346-af0f-106fbe5f6292","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199199.763179,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Sim, há estudos e análises acadêmicas que fazem comparações entre a Lei de Moore e a expansão da inteligência artificial (IA), explorando como os avanços em hardware impactam o desenvolvimento e a evolução da IA.

Ele explora como o aumento exponencial da densidade de transistores tem permitido o desenvolvimento de algoritmos de IA mais complexos e eficientes.\n\n2. **\"The Computational Limits of Deep Learning\" (2017)**:\n   - Publicado por pesquisadores da OpenAI, este estudo examina os requisitos computacionais dos modelos de deep learning e discute como esses requisitos se alinham com a Lei de Moore. Ele destaca que, embora a capacidade de hardware tenha crescido exponencialmente, o custo e a demanda por poder computacional também aumentaram significativamente.\n\n3. **\"Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models\" (2020)**:\n   - Este estudo investiga como o desempenho dos modelos de linguagem neural melhora com o aumento do poder computacional e do tamanho do modelo, fornecendo uma análise quantitativa da relação entre recursos computacionais e desempenho em IA.\n\n### Principais Comparações e Pontos de Discussão\n\n1. **Crescimento Exponencial**:\n   - Assim como a Lei de Moore prevê o crescimento exponencial da capacidade de processamento dos chips, a capacidade e o desempenho dos modelos de IA têm mostrado crescimento semelhante. Estudos mostram que, com mais dados e maior capacidade computacional, os modelos de IA, especialmente de deep learning, podem aprender representações mais complexas e realizar tarefas mais sofisticadas.\n\n2. **Custo e Eficiência**:\n   - A Lei de Moore tem contribuído para a redução dos custos do hardware, o que, por sua vez, tem tornado mais acessível a implementação de soluções de IA em larga escala. No entanto, o treinamento de grandes modelos de IA ainda requer recursos significativos, e há um debate contínuo sobre a sustentabilidade desse crescimento em termos de energia e custo.\n\n3. **Limites Físicos e Alternativas**:\n   - Com a aproximação dos limites físicos da miniaturização dos transistores, novas tecnologias, como a computação quântica e as arquiteturas neuromórficas, estão sendo exploradas. Essas tecnologias podem oferecer caminhos alternativos para continuar a expansão da IA além dos limites da Lei de Moore.\n\n4. **Impacto na Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento de IA**:\n   - A disponibilidade de hardware mais potente tem permitido avanços rápidos na pesquisa de IA, facilitando a experimentação e o desenvolvimento de novos algoritmos. Modelos como o GPT-3 e outros grandes modelos de linguagem são exemplos de como o aumento da capacidade de hardware pode levar a avanços significativos na IA.\n\n### Conclusão\n\nA relação entre a Lei de Moore e a expansão da IA é bem documentada e analisada em várias publicações acadêmicas. O crescimento exponencial da capacidade de processamento tem sido um fator crucial para os avanços na IA, permitindo o desenvolvimento de algoritmos mais complexos e poderosos.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below. Holding hardware improvements constant, newer versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch AI frameworks in concert with novel training methods combine to generate an 8x performance gain, as shown in the right chart below.[4]\n\n[Image 9: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nCuriously, AI training chip costs have not dropped in tandem with unit hardware prices.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","title":"Large Language Models: A New Moore's Law?","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"_cite_metadata":{"citation_format":{"name":"tether_og"},"metadata_list":[{"type":"webpage","title":"Large Language Models: A New Moore's Law?","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/large-language-models","text":"  * 【17†So?】 \n  * 【18†Use Pretrained Models】 \n  * 【19†Use Smaller Models】 \n  * 【20†Fine-Tune Models】 \n  * 【21†Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure】 \n  * 【22†Optimize Your Models】 \n  * 【23†Conclusion】 \n\nA few days ago, Microsoft and NVIDIA 【24†introduced†www.microsoft.com】 Megatron-Turing NLG 530B, a Transformer-based model hailed as \"the world’s largest and most powerful generative language model.\"\n\nThis is an impressive show of Machine Learning engineering, no doubt about it.

Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below. Holding hardware improvements constant, newer versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch AI frameworks in concert with novel training methods combine to generate an 8x performance gain, as shown in the right chart below.[4]\n\n[Image 9: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nCuriously, AI training chip costs have not dropped in tandem with unit hardware prices. The price of Nvidia’s data center GPU, for example, has tripled over the 【60†last three generations.†investor.nvidia.com】 In fact, Amazon Web Services has not lowered the price of Nvidia’s V100 GPU instances since it introduced them 【61†in 2017.†aws.amazon.com】 Competition from independent and hyperscale AI chip designs does have the potential to erode Nvidia’s pricing power, but so far, no company has been able to field a comparable chip to Nvidia’s V100 GPU with the same breadth of software and developer support.\n\n[Image 10: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nForecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2019 \n\nBased on the pace of its cost decline, AI is in very early days. During the first decade of Moore’s Law, transistor count doubled every year—or at twice the rate of change seen during decades thereafter. The 10-100x cost declines we are witnessing in both AI training and AI inference suggest that AI is nascent in its development, perhaps with decades of slower but sustained growth ahead. As shown above, based on ARK’s research, while thus far AI has added roughly $1 trillion to the global equity market cap, it is poised to scale to $30 trillion by 2037, becoming the first foundational technology to dwarf the internet.\n\n【62†Based on ARK’s research, while thus far AI has added roughly $1 trillion to the global equity market cap, it is poised to scale to $30 trillion by 2037, becoming the first foundational technology to dwarf the internet.†twitter.com】\n\n  *   1  【59† https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO †arkinv.st】 \n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench). \n\n  *   2 \n\nForecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. \n\n  *   3  【59† https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO †arkinv.st】 \n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench). \n\n  *   4  【59† https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO †arkinv.st】 \n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench). \n\n### ARK Podcast\n\n  * 【63† †open.spotify.com】 \n  * 【64† †podcasts.apple.com】 \n  * 【65† †podcasts.google.com】 \n\n### Follow ARK:\n\n#### Tags:\n\n【66†Deep Learning】 \n\n### Related Research\n\nBy 【67†James Wang†ark-invest.com】 \n\n【68† 】 \n\nAnalyst Research\n\n###  【68†Could Deep Learning Grow the Robotics Market Ten-Fold (or More)?】 \n\nTags:  【66†Deep Learning】, 【69†Robotics】 \n\n【68†See More】 \n\nBy 【67†James Wang†ark-invest.com】 \n\n【70† 】 \n\nAnalyst Research\n\n###  【70†Deep Learning Based Diagnostics: Unlocking a $16 Billion Market】 \n\nTags:  【71†Cancer Treatment】, 【66†Deep Learning】, 【72†Diagnostics】, 【73†Digital】, 【74†Health】, 【75†Machine Learning】, 【76†Radiiology】 \n\n【70†See More】 \n\nBy 【67†James Wang†ark-invest.com】 \n\n【77† 】 \n\nAnalyst Research\n\n###  【77†Google: The Full Stack AI Company】 \n\nTags:  【78†Big Data】, 【66†Deep Learning】, 【73†Digital】 \n\n【77†See More】 \n\n【79†See all articles†ark-invest.com】 \n\n\"Close\"\n\n【2† 】 \n\nARK Investment Management LLC\n\ninfo@ark-invest.com\n\n  * 【80† †twitter.com】\n  * 【81† †www.instagram.com】\n  * 【82† †www.linkedin.com】\n  * 【83† †www.facebook.com】\n  * 【84† †www.youtube.com】\n\n【85†ARK ETFs†ark-funds.com】 【86†ARK Venture Fund†ark-ventures.com】 【87†ARK Research】 \n\nInvestment Strategies\n\n  * 【3†ARK Disruptive Innovation】\n  * 【6†Next Generation Internet】\n  * 【5†Genomic Revolution】\n  * 【4†Autonomous Tech. & Robotics】\n  * 【7†Fintech Innovation】\n  * 【8†Space Exploration】\n  * 【11†3D Printing】\n  * 【12†Israel Innovation】\n  * 【88†Cryptocurrency】\n  * 【89†Cryptoasset】\n  * 【20†ARK Venture】\n  * 【90†ARK Early Stage Disruptors】\n  * 【91†ARK 10】\n  * 【92†Mobility-as-a-Service】\n  * 【93†Metaverse】\n  * 【94†Positive Change】\n  * 【13†Circular Economy】\n  * 【14†Cybersecurity and Data Privacy】\n  * 【15†Digital Payments Economy】\n  * 【16†Environmental Impact】\n  * 【17†Global Sustainable Infrastructure】\n  * 【18†Sustainable Future of Food","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":14,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":923,"end_ix":934,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Large Language Models: A New Moore's Law?","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/large-language-models","text":"  * 【17†So?】 \n  * 【18†Use Pretrained Models】 \n  * 【19†Use Smaller Models】 \n  * 【20†Fine-Tune Models】 \n  * 【21†Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure】 \n  * 【22†Optimize Your Models】 \n  * 【23†Conclusion】 \n\nA few days ago, Microsoft and NVIDIA 【24†introduced†www.microsoft.com】 Megatron-Turing NLG 530B, a Transformer-based model hailed as \"the world’s largest and most powerful generative language model.\"\n\nThis is an impressive show of Machine Learning engineering, no doubt about it. Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","attribution":"huggingface.co","icon_type":null}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d61a35fe-6d25-4d05-874f-8229eec786e8","children":["d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117"]},"d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117":{"id":"d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117","message":{"id":"d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199387.439176,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Você poderia me apresentar uma prévia desses gráficos, com a citação, para que eu possa refletir se servem de argumentos para um artigo científico de minha autoria ?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"892a3ad98b697df7-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"79cd4d62-28ac-44e7-bf44-eddbb04b43aa","children":["3b593125-1bac-477d-aaa0-91bea8220c06"]},"3b593125-1bac-477d-aaa0-91bea8220c06":{"id":"3b593125-1bac-477d-aaa0-91bea8220c06","message":{"id":"3b593125-1bac-477d-aaa0-91bea8220c06","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199407.358708,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Claro, aqui estão prévias de gráficos e as respectivas citações que comparam a Lei de Moore com a expansão da IA, que podem ser úteis para seu artigo científico:\n\n### Gráfico 1: Custo de Treinamento de IA em Comparação com a Lei de Moore\n**Fonte:** ARK Investment Management LLC\n- **Descrição:** Este gráfico ilustra que o custo de treinamento de IA está melhorando a uma taxa 50 vezes mais rápida que a Lei de Moore.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below. Holding hardware improvements constant, newer versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch AI frameworks in concert with novel training methods combine to generate an 8x performance gain, as shown in the right chart below.[4]\n\n[Image 9: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nCuriously, AI training chip costs have not dropped in tandem with unit hardware prices.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":15,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117","request_id":"892a3ad98b697df7-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"content_references":[{"matched_text":"【14†source】","start_idx":738,"end_idx":749,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"AI Training Costs Are Improving at 50x the Speed of Moore’s Law","url":"https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/ai-training/","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\n# The Cost of AI Training is Improving at 50x the Speed of Moore’s Law: Why It’s Still Early Days for AI\n\nMay 06, 2020\n\n6 min read\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n[Image 5: ARK-Invest_Blog-Banner_2020_05_06---AI Chips] \n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nBy: James Wang \n\n  * 【53† More from James Wang 】 \n  * Join the conversation \n\nThe cost to train an artificial intelligence (AI) system is improving at 50x the pace of Moore’s Law.

After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded.

As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below. Holding hardware improvements constant, newer versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch AI frameworks in concert with novel training methods combine to generate an 8x performance gain, as shown in the right chart below.[4]\n\n[Image 9: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nCuriously, AI training chip costs have not dropped in tandem with unit hardware prices. The price of Nvidia’s data center GPU, for example, has tripled over the 【60†last three generations.†investor.nvidia.com】 In fact, Amazon Web Services has not lowered the price of Nvidia’s V100 GPU instances since it introduced them 【61†in 2017.†aws.amazon.com】 Competition from independent and hyperscale AI chip designs does have the potential to erode Nvidia’s pricing power, but so far, no company has been able to field a comparable chip to Nvidia’s V100 GPU with the same breadth of software and developer support.\n\n[Image 10: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\nForecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2019 \n\nBased on the pace of its cost decline, AI is in very early days.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","attribution":"huggingface.co","icon_type":null}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d628e884-d5ff-446b-9d82-3c2f9f1f3117","children":["0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3"]},"0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3":{"id":"0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3","message":{"id":"0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199434.612107,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["os links nano geraram arquivos "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"892a3c007c527df7-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"3b593125-1bac-477d-aaa0-91bea8220c06","children":["6c1fe4d3-7669-4c60-8744-a359d76416fc"]},"6c1fe4d3-7669-4c60-8744-a359d76416fc":{"id":"6c1fe4d3-7669-4c60-8744-a359d76416fc","message":{"id":"6c1fe4d3-7669-4c60-8744-a359d76416fc","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199466.945075,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Parece que os links não geraram arquivos diretamente.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":15,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}}],"gizmo_id":null,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AA","parent_id":"0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"892a3c007c527df7-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute","content_references":[{"matched_text":"【14†source】","start_idx":966,"end_idx":977,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"AI Training Costs Are Improving at 50x the Speed of Moore’s Law","url":"https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/ai-training/","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\n# The Cost of AI Training is Improving at 50x the Speed of Moore’s Law: Why It’s Still Early Days for AI\n\nMay 06, 2020\n\n6 min read\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\n[Image 5: ARK-Invest_Blog-Banner_2020_05_06---AI Chips] \n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nBy: James Wang \n\n  * 【53† More from James Wang 】 \n  * Join the conversation \n\nThe cost to train an artificial intelligence (AI) system is improving at 50x the pace of Moore’s Law.

For many use cases, the cost to run an AI inference system has collapsed to almost nil. After just five years of development, deep learning – the modern incarnation of AI – seems to have reached a tipping point in both cost and performance, paving the way for widespread adoption over the next decade.\n\nDuring the past ten years, the computing resources devoted to AI training models have exploded. After doubling every two years from 1960 to 2010, AI compute complexity has soared 10x every year, as shown below.\n\n[Image 6: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang]\n\n*A “ Petaflop-Day” refers to performing a quadrillion operations per second for a day.\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, “AI and Compute.” OpenAI, 【54†https://arkinv.st/2ZOH2Rr†arkinv.st】. This is not a recommendation in relation to any named securities and no warranty or guarantee is provided. Any references to particular securities are for illustrative purposes only.\n\nWe believe that companies have had ample incentive to increase computing resources at five times the rate of Moore’s Law: significant competitive advantages in revenue generation and hardware cost declines rapid enough to keep fueling the beast. As so-called hyperscale internet companies have taken the reins from universities and trained deep learning networks on their data, they have budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars for AI hardware, expecting superior rates of return on investment over time.【55†[1]】\n\nJust as important, AI training costs have dropped roughly 10x every year. In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously. During the past two years, for example, the cost to classify one billion images has fallen from $10,000 to just $0.03, as shown below.【58†[3]】\n\n[Image 7: AI Training, deep learning, ARK Research, James Wang] [Image 8]\n\nSource: ARK Investment Management LLC, Stanford DAWN Deep Learning Benchmark (DAWNBench), 【59†https://arkinv.st/2MUITyO†arkinv.st】.\n\nBreakthroughs in both hardware and software have enabled these cost declines.  In the past three years, chip and system design have evolved to add dedicated hardware for deep learning, resulting in a 16x performance improvement, as shown in the left chart below.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years. This is starting to look like another 【52†Moore's Law†en.wikipedia.org】. \n\nWe've been there before, and we should know that this road leads to diminishing returns, higher cost, more complexity, and new risks. Exponentials tend not to end well. Remember 【53†Meltdown and Spectre†meltdownattack.com】? Do we want to find out what that looks like for AI?\n\nInstead of chasing trillion-parameter models (place your","attribution":"huggingface.co","icon_type":null}]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0610c27d-cc2d-4a3d-9e72-df5b33b39fd3","children":["7ee518d7-8feb-47d6-966a-643046d008c2"]},"7ee518d7-8feb-47d6-966a-643046d008c2":{"id":"7ee518d7-8feb-47d6-966a-643046d008c2","message":{"id":"7ee518d7-8feb-47d6-966a-643046d008c2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199533.558285,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["os links levaram para páginas nao encontradas com o erro \"404\""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"892a3e6afa027df7-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"6c1fe4d3-7669-4c60-8744-a359d76416fc","children":["4345e40d-38c7-4019-934d-472b6be658fb"]},"4345e40d-38c7-4019-934d-472b6be658fb":{"id":"4345e40d-38c7-4019-934d-472b6be658fb","message":{"id":"4345e40d-38c7-4019-934d-472b6be658fb","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718199557.370409,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Aqui estão prévias de gráficos e as respectivas citações que comparam a Lei de Moore com a expansão da IA, que podem ser úteis para seu artigo científico.

In 2017, for example, the cost to train an image recognition network like 【56†ResNet-50†dawn.cs.stanford.edu】 on a public cloud was ~$1,000. In 2019, the cost dropped to ~$10, as shown below. At the current rate of improvement, the cost should fall to $1 by the end of this year.【57†[2]】 The cost of inference—running a trained neural network in production—has dropped even more precipitously.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years.

Yet, should we be excited about this mega-model trend? I, for one, am not. Here's why.\n\n` [Image 0] `\n\n###  【14† 】  This is your Brain on Deep Learning \n\nResearchers estimate that the human brain contains an average of 【25†86 billion neurons†pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov】 and 100 trillion synapses. It's safe to assume that not all of them are dedicated to language either. Interestingly, GPT-4 is 【26†expected†www.wired.com】 to have about 100 trillion parameters... As crude as this analogy is, shouldn't we wonder whether building language models that are about the size of the human brain is the best long-term approach?\n\nOf course, our brain is a marvelous device, produced by millions of years of evolution, while Deep Learning models are only a few decades old. Still, our intuition should tell us that something doesn't compute (pun intended).\n\n###  【15† 】  Deep Learning, Deep Pockets? \n\nAs you would expect, training a 530-billion parameter model on humongous text datasets requires a fair bit of infrastructure. In fact, Microsoft and NVIDIA used hundreds of DGX A100 multi-GPU servers. At $199,000 a piece, and factoring in networking equipment, hosting costs, etc., anyone looking to replicate this experiment would have to spend close to $100 million dollars. Want fries with that?\n\nSeriously, which organizations have business use cases that would justify spending $100 million on Deep Learning infrastructure? Or even $10 million? Very few. So who are these models for, really?\n\n###  【16† 】  That Warm Feeling is your GPU Cluster \n\nFor all its engineering brilliance, training Deep Learning models on GPUs is a brute force technique. According to the spec sheet, each DGX server can consume up to 6.5 kilowatts. Of course, you'll need at least as much cooling power in your datacenter (or your server closet). Unless you're the Starks and need to keep Winterfell warm in winter, that's another problem you'll have to deal with. \n\nIn addition, as public awareness grows on climate and social responsibility issues, organizations need to account for their carbon footprint. According to this 2019 【27†study†arxiv.org】 from the University of Massachusetts, \"training BERT on GPU is roughly equivalent to a trans-American flight\".\n\nBERT-Large has 340 million parameters. One can only extrapolate what the footprint of Megatron-Turing could be... People who know me wouldn't call me a bleeding-heart environmentalist. Still, some numbers are hard to ignore.\n\n###  【17† 】  So? \n\nAm I excited by Megatron-Turing NLG 530B and whatever beast is coming next? No. Do I think that the (relatively small) benchmark improvement is worth the added cost, complexity and carbon footprint? No. Do I think that building and promoting these huge models is helping organizations understand and adopt Machine Learning ? No.\n\nI'm left wondering what's the point of it all. Science for the sake of science? Good old marketing? Technological supremacy? Probably a bit of each. I'll leave them to it, then.\n\nInstead, let me focus on pragmatic and actionable techniques that you can all use to build high quality Machine Learning solutions.\n\n###  【18† 】  Use Pretrained Models \n\nIn the vast majority of cases, you won't need a custom model architecture. Maybe you'll want a custom one (which is a different thing), but there be dragons. Experts only!\n\nA good starting point is to look for 【1†models】 that have been pretrained for the task you're trying to solve (say, 【28†summarizing English text】).\n\nThen, you should quickly try out a few models to predict your own data. If metrics tell you that one works well enough, you're done! If you need a little more accuracy, you should consider fine-tuning the model (more on this in a minute).\n\n###  【19† 】  Use Smaller Models \n\nWhen evaluating models, you should pick the smallest one that can deliver the accuracy you need. It will predict faster and require fewer hardware resources for training and inference. Frugality goes a long way.\n\nIt's nothing new either. Computer Vision practitioners will remember when 【29†SqueezeNet†arxiv.org】 came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to 【30†AlexNet†papers.nips.cc】, while meeting or exceeding its accuracy. How clever that was!\n\nDownsizing efforts are also under way in the Natural Language Processing community, using transfer learning techniques such as 【31†knowledge distillation†en.wikipedia.org】. 【32†DistilBERT†arxiv.org】 is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it 【33†here】. The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's 【34†BART†arxiv.org】, and you can try DistilBART 【35†here】.\n\nRecent models from the 【36†Big Science†bigscience.huggingface.co】 project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the 【37†research paper†arxiv.org】, their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.\n\n` [Image 1] `\n\nYou can try T0 【38†here】. This is the kind of research we need more of!\n\n###  【20† 】  Fine-Tune Models \n\nIf you need to specialize a model, there should be very few reasons to train it from scratch. Instead, you should fine-tune it, that is to say train it only for a few epochs on your own data. If you're short on data, maybe of one these 【2†datasets】 can get you started.\n\nYou guessed it, that's another way to do transfer learning, and it'll help you save on everything!\n\n  * Less data to collect, store, clean and annotate,\n  * Faster experiments and iterations,\n  * Fewer resources required in production.\n\nIn other words: save time, save money, save hardware resources, save the world! \n\nIf you need a tutorial, the Hugging Face 【39†course】 will get you started in no time.\n\n###  【21† 】  Use Cloud-Based Infrastructure \n\nLike them or not, cloud companies know how to build efficient infrastructure. Sustainability studies show that cloud-based infrastructure is more energy and carbon efficient than the alternative: see 【40†AWS†sustainability.aboutamazon.com】, 【41†Azure†azure.microsoft.com】, and 【42†Google†cloud.google.com】. Earth.org 【43†says†earth.org】 that while cloud infrastructure is not perfect, \"[it's] more energy efficient than the alternative and facilitates environmentally beneficial services and economic growth.\"\n\nCloud certainly has a lot going for it when it comes to ease of use, flexibility and pay as you go. It's also a little greener than you probably thought. If you're short on GPUs, why not try fine-tune your Hugging Face models on 【44†Amazon SageMaker†aws.amazon.com】, AWS' managed service for Machine Learning? We've got 【45†plenty of examples】 for you.\n\n###  【22† 】  Optimize Your Models \n\nFrom compilers to virtual machines, software engineers have long used tools that automatically optimize their code for whatever hardware they're running on. \n\nHowever, the Machine Learning community is still struggling with this topic, and for good reason. Optimizing models for size and speed is a devilishly complex task, which involves techniques such as:\n\n  * Specialized hardware that speeds up training (【46†Graphcore†www.graphcore.ai】, 【47†Habana†habana.ai】) and inference (【48†Google TPU†cloud.google.com】, 【49†AWS Inferentia†aws.amazon.com】).\n  * Pruning: remove model parameters that have little or no impact on the predicted outcome.\n  * Fusion: merge model layers (say, convolution and activation).\n  * Quantization: storing model parameters in smaller values (say, 8 bits instead of 32 bits)\n\nFortunately, automated tools are starting to appear, such as the 【50†Optimum】 open source library, and 【51†Infinity】, a containerized solution that delivers Transformers accuracy at 1-millisecond latency.\n\n###  【23† 】  Conclusion \n\nLarge language model size has been increasing 10x every year for the last few years.

The BG Strategy breaks down the BE into five main sectors: Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Coastal and Maritime Tourism, Aquaculture and Mineral Resources, and integrates other sectors such as fishing, transportation, offshore oil and gas extraction, and ship construction and repair.\n\nBiotechnology presents excellent opportunities to produce natural products with possible applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors [【49†105】, 【50†119】]. It is a recent and developing sector that is part of the bioeconomy, the latter developing and using renewable biological resources from the land and sea. For example, the cultivation of seaweed is expected to provide sustainable biomass that facilitates the development of the marine bioeconomy through BG [【51†43】] and is considered an industrial benchmark for achieving a competitive, circular, and sustainable economy that is less dependent on fossil carbon [【52†9】].\n\nRenewable wind energy from marine sources and the conversion of thermal energy from the ocean is increasingly present at the global ocean level [【53†126】, 【54†129】]. Novel hybrid robust/stochastic approaches are used to participate in the electricity market, including renewable energy procurement through large consumer purchases that respond to the energy demands of wind turbines voyer (WT), photovoltaic systems (PV), bilateral contracts (BCs), and micro-turbines (MTs), and energy storage systems (ESS) [【55†1】]. Other strategies focus on the optimal programming of electrical energy consumption in multiple cooling systems [【56†108】] or models based on heat and energy centers [【57†70】].\n\nTourism has played a decisive role in developing many island economies, triggering other activities to obtain local economic returns. Similarly, aquaculture and fisheries have contributed to the economic development of certain regions without jeopardizing access to essential resources such as small-scale fisheries [【58†15】, 【59†39】, 【45†109】]. The exploitation and extraction of offshore oil and gas is a reality in many economies around the world wherein nations must weigh the economic benefits against the negative impact it may have on living marine resources [【60†78】, 【61†92】, 【44†131】].\n\nGlobally, shipping is the primary means of supplying raw materials, consumer goods, and energy, becoming a facilitator of world trade and contributing to economic growth and employment, both at sea and on land [【62†81】]. In addition, the shipbuilding industry provides real added value to numerous coastal communities [【63†114】].\n\nThrough bibliometric analysis, this study’s main objective is to explore the evolution of worldwide scientific production on BE between 1979 and 2020. The purpose is also to identify those concepts that are related to BE in order to subsequently carry out the study of keywords and establish future research trends.\n\nIts main contribution is the assimilation of the BE into the CE since both are key to supporting BG and guaranteeing the sustainability of economic activities developed within the blue context. BE encompasses activities related to renewable energy use, waste management, climate change, fisheries and tourism, where the concept of economic circulation (based on recycling, extension, redistribution and manufacturing) can be integrated, moving from a linear economy to an economy that makes the most of waste through circular flow [【64†60】, 【65†112】, 【66†133】]. Analyzing the possible connections, we start from the study carried out by Ruiz-Real et al. [【67†107】], referring to the analysis of the global dynamics of the CE, where trend words related to renewable energy, climate change and waste management are located, finding an explicit link with almost all of the activities promoted by the BE shown in Fig. 【68†2】. Furthermore, although there is no visible link on the fisheries and water issue in the BE and CE, it should be mentioned that fisheries depend on water, as their life cycle depends on this natural environment and both its conditions (quality, temperature, salinity) and its proper management influence the sustainability and conservation of marine species [【69†36】, 【70†106】].\n\nFig. 2\n\n[Image 1: figure 2]\n\nAnalysis of relationships between BE and CE\n\n【71†Full size image】\n\nAn important aspect relates to the conflict between the interest groups of BD versus the economic development proposed by both the BE and the BG. Thus, the CE presents itself as a mediator between growth, economic development and employment while extending resource availability and reducing environmental and social pressures.\n\n## Methodology \n\nBibliometry offers useful results from the authors’ production in a field of research, trends, the most cited articles, and the concentration of documents in impact journals [【72†63】].\n\nThe first step was to select the terms through a prior review of those economies linked to the seas and oceans, with BE, BG, ME, and OE being the most representative terms.\n\nThe next step involved locating and extracting data on all the documents in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection that contain the terms established in the search criteria in order to visualize the behavior of scientific production over time, providing high-quality data and a complete description that facilitates data processing and for the broad recognition it has obtained in the scientific community [【73†89】, 【74†98】]. For this study, the WoS database was selected. This database is widely recognized for gathering reliable and multidisciplinary research, with studies recommending its use due to the high proportion of exclusive journals [【75†83】].\n\nA similar search query was carried out on the Scopus database using the same criteria to guarantee the data’s completeness. The results were similar to those obtained from WoS [【76†44】, 【77†53】, 【78†80】].\n\nThe data was then processed to analyze the number of articles published per year, the number of citations, and their h-index. Bibliometric analysis, the study of the scientific activity of authors, has been used to prepare this article and has been used in various areas.\n\nFigure 【79†3】 depicts the descriptive statistical analysis of the main variables: cites per article, total cites, h-index, year, and articles. The matrix indicates the correlation between them (the closer to 1, the stronger the correlation; if the values are closer to − 1, there is an inverse correlation between variables, while if there is a zero value, there is no correlation). In the present case, the articles variable is highly correlated with the total of citations, h-index, and years. In contrast, there is an inverse correlation with the variable cites per article and year.\n\nFig. 3\n\n[Image 2: figure 3]\n\nCorrelation matrix of main variables\n\n【80†Full size image】\n\nIn this work, the number of articles, citations, citations per article, and h-index, the most relevant countries, institutions, and authors are studied. The keywords are also taken into account in order to discover new lines of research. A database search has been carried out, filtering by topic in the title, the abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus. The search for the keywords was carried out using the terms: “blue economy” or “ocean economy” or “blue growth” or “maritime economy” or “marine economy.” In the next stage, 780 results were obtained, from which articles were filtered, leaving 499 articles to be processed and analyzed in the fourth stage. The results were then filtered to include only articles as many of them have been published in journals with an impact factor in Journal Citation Reports (JCR). This indicator is highly regarded and valued by organizations that evaluate research activity, guaranteeing a strict review process and high-quality results [【81†32】, 【82†47】, 【83†82】].\n\nLastly, once the document search was filtered to include only articles, the data were exported and processed using two tools: Vosviewer and Biblioshiny. In this way, clusters can be created by downloading information from the Web of Science database.\n\nThe VOSviewer program offers the basic functionality necessary to visualize bibliometric networks, citation links between publications, collaboration between researchers, and co-occurrence links between scientific terms [【84†128】]. According to a logical bibliometric workflow, the Bibliometrix tool, developed in the statistical and graphical language R, is also used to add weight to the study. R is highly extensible as it uses a functional, object-oriented programming language, and therefore it is relatively easy to automate parsing and create new functions. It is utilized to create graphs for three metrics at different levels: sources, authors, and documents, and analyzing knowledge structures at the conceptual, intellectual and social level [【85†5】] (Fig. 【86†4】).\n\nFig. 4\n\n[Image 3: figure 4]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS)\n\nThe data collection process\n\n【87†Full size image】\n\n## Results\n\n### Descriptive analysis \n\nFigure 【88†5】 represents a descriptive analysis of the terms ME, OE, BE, and BG, making a note of the chronological order of the articles when these concepts first appeared.\n\nFig. 5\n\n[Image 4: figure 5]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS data)\n\nTimeline of first published articles related to BE, BG, ME, and OE\n\n【89†Full size image】\n\nThe first mention of ME appeared in 1979 in the article entitled “Marine Economy of Poland 1945–1975”.

Therefore, in this study, two main social-economic factors including per capita Gross Regional Product (GRP_{pc}) and urban population rate (UPR) were collected at the provincial level in China (Table 【53†1】). The UPR was calculated as the proportion (%) of people living in urban areas of the total population. \n\nTable 1 Indicator selected in the study (2002–2018)\n\n【54†Full size table】\n\n### Methodology\n\n#### Distribution pattern detection\n\n### Global spatial autocorrelation\n\nGlobal spatial autocorrelation indexed by Moran’s I method is a powerful tool to quantitatively provide the indicators varying geographically and to explore the spatial autocorrelation among samples [【55†35】]. This method has been widely applied to examine spatial patterns, i.e., clustered, dispersed, or random distributions [【56†36】,【57†37】,【58†38】,【59†39】]. To explore the spatial autocorrelation of population aging indicators, Moran’s I was adopted in this paper, which can be calculated as follows [【60†40】]: \n\n$$ I=\\frac{n\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)\\left({x}_j-\\overline{x}\\right)}{\\sum_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(1) \n\nIn Eq. (【61†1】), n represents the number of spatial units (the province in this case) indexed by i and j; x represents the selected variables; \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean of x; the weights W ij are written in an (n × n) weight matrix which depicts the relationship between the variable and its surrounding ones. In the current study, the contiguity-based method was conducted for identifying the weight matrix, and the queen criterion as spatial units sharing a common edge or a vertex was selected to determine neighbors. The global spatial autocorrelation was performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n### Kernel density estimation\n\nKernel density estimation (KDE) is commonly used to estimate the density function based on a set of observations and random variables from an unknown distribution function. This method does not need any hypothesis for the data distribution. Thus, the general distribution patterns in population aging indicators can be described visually based on the kernel density function curves. In this study, the KDE calculation is presented as follows [【62†41】]: \n\n$$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{nh}{\\sum}_{i=1}^tK\\left(\\frac{x_i-x}{h}\\right) $$\n\n(2) \n\nIn Eq. (【63†2】), n is the total number of locations, x i is the value of i th population aging indicators, and h is the bandwidth. K is a kernel density function and the Gaussian kernel was adopted in this paper.\n\n### Coefficient of variation\n\nThe coefficient of variation (COV) is an effective method to measure the dispersion degree of an indicator [【64†42】, 【65†43】]. The COV is indicated in convergence analysis because it does not depend on the measurement unit and the measure order of the indicators [【66†44】]. In this paper, this method is adopted which could be shown as follows: \n\n$$ {\\sigma}_t=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}_{i=1}^n{\\left({x}_t-{\\overline{x}}_t\\right)}^2}}{{\\overline{x}}_t} $$\n\n(3) \n\nIn Eq. (【67†3】), t refers to the year, and n denotes the total number of provinces. x represents the population aging indicators and \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean value in year t. σ t represents the COV of the selected indicators. In this paper, the calculation of COV expresses the dispersion degree of the population aging indicators compared to the average levels.\n\n#### Evolution patterns analysis \n\nThe center of gravity is a physical concept. Then, it has been widely adopted to investigate spatial distribution, such as population [【32†14】], energy consumption [【68†45】], carbon emissions [【69†46】], and economic growth [【70†47】], etc. In this paper, the center of gravity method was used to analyze the spatial evolution of population aging and social-economic indicators. Each provincial-level administrative region is assumed to be located on a homogeneous two-dimension surface without accounting for the altitude dimension, and that the indicators by each region are concentrated in the provincial capital cities. Each provincial capital city then acts as a particle on the surface, with weights determined based on the indicator’s quantity. This simplification is a necessary step because finer-grained data (e.g., at the prefectural and county levels) is not yet available in this study. Then, the spatial positions of the gravity centers were calculated according to a combination of the geographical coordinates of the provincial capital cities and their corresponding weights. The position of the gravity center is expressed in terms of longitude and latitude, which can be calculated as follows: \n\n$$ {X}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{x}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(4) \n\n$$ {Y}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{y}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(5) \n\nIn Eq. (【71†4】) and (【72†5】), X t and Y t are the longitude and latitude coordinates of the gravity center in year t, respectively. M ti represents the population aging and social-economic indicators by province i in year t. (x i, y i) represent the longitude and latitude coordinates of the provincial capital city of province i, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial movement distance for the gravity center can be expressed as follows: \n\n$$ {D}_{t2-t1}=\\sqrt{{\\left({X}_{t2}-{X}_{t1}\\right)}^2+{\\left({Y}_{t2}-{Y}_{t1}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(6) \n\nIn Eq. (【73†6】), D _{t2-t1} is the movement distance of the gravity center (km) between the year t _{2} and t _{1}, and X _{t1}, X t2, and Y _{t1}, Y _{t2} are gravity center coordinates for the years t _{1} and t _{2}. The differences in the movement of these gravity centers represent the changes in the balance over time. In this paper, Arc GIS software (version 10.2) was used to calculate the gravity centers in each year and connect each center in turn to define the movement paths followed by these centers annually from 2002 to 2018.\n\n#### Bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis \n\nBivariate spatial autocorrelation is considered to be the correlation between one variable and the spatial lag of another variable [【74†48】]. The bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis is commonly indexed by bivariate Moran’s I, whereas the original Moran’s I statistic measured the degree of linear association of the values of a variable in neighboring regions. The bivariate Moran’s I statistic provides an indication of the degree of linear association between one variable and a different variable in neighboring regions. Meanwhile, the bivariate local indicators of spatial association (BiLISA) which closely follows that of its global counterpart was applied in this study to capture the relationship between the value for one variable at a location and the average of the neighboring values for another variable [【74†48】]. In this study, bivariate Moran’s I between population aging indicators and social-economic factors were calculated and the cluster maps of BiLISA were drawn with a p-value < 0.05 which were performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n#### Exploratory data analysis \n\nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated between population aging indicators and social-economic factors during the study period. The results showed that Pearson’s correlation coefficients were positively significant in most years based on two-tailed tests (see the supplementary tables).\n\n## Results\n\n### Spatial-temporal variations and distribution patterns\n\n#### Overall spatial-temporal variations \n\nThe variation of population aging and social-economic factors at the provincial level in China with a five-year interval in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were depicted in Fig. 【75†1】. Several key points of the spatial-temporal variation trend can be concluded. First, the spatial difference of two population aging indicators showed a similarity that the eastern part of China (e.g., Liaoning, Beijing, Jiangsu) and Sichuan Province exhibited the highest values, and most provinces in the western part of China showed relatively lower values. Further, several provinces in southern China such as Guangdong and Fujian provinces showe","title":"Exploring the spatial-temporal distribution and evolution of population aging and social-economic indicators in China | BMC Public Health | Full Text","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":0.0,"metadata":{"_cite_metadata":{"citation_format":{"name":"tether_og"},"metadata_list":[{"type":"webpage","title":"Exploring the spatial-temporal distribution and evolution of population aging and social-economic indicators in China | BMC Public Health | Full Text","url":"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11032-z","text":"\n#### Social-economic factors \n\nThe association between population aging and social-economic development (e.g., GDP and urbanization levels) has been widely conducted at the country level [【41†23】, 【51†33】, 【52†34】].

Therefore, in this study, two main social-economic factors including per capita Gross Regional Product (GRP_{pc}) and urban population rate (UPR) were collected at the provincial level in China (Table 【53†1】). The UPR was calculated as the proportion (%) of people living in urban areas of the total population. \n\nTable 1 Indicator selected in the study (2002–2018)\n\n【54†Full size table】\n\n### Methodology\n\n#### Distribution pattern detection\n\n### Global spatial autocorrelation\n\nGlobal spatial autocorrelation indexed by Moran’s I method is a powerful tool to quantitatively provide the indicators varying geographically and to explore the spatial autocorrelation among samples [【55†35】]. This method has been widely applied to examine spatial patterns, i.e., clustered, dispersed, or random distributions [【56†36】,【57†37】,【58†38】,【59†39】]. To explore the spatial autocorrelation of population aging indicators, Moran’s I was adopted in this paper, which can be calculated as follows [【60†40】]: \n\n$$ I=\\frac{n\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)\\left({x}_j-\\overline{x}\\right)}{\\sum_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(1) \n\nIn Eq. (【61†1】), n represents the number of spatial units (the province in this case) indexed by i and j; x represents the selected variables; \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean of x; the weights W ij are written in an (n × n) weight matrix which depicts the relationship between the variable and its surrounding ones. In the current study, the contiguity-based method was conducted for identifying the weight matrix, and the queen criterion as spatial units sharing a common edge or a vertex was selected to determine neighbors. The global spatial autocorrelation was performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n### Kernel density estimation\n\nKernel density estimation (KDE) is commonly used to estimate the density function based on a set of observations and random variables from an unknown distribution function. This method does not need any hypothesis for the data distribution. Thus, the general distribution patterns in population aging indicators can be described visually based on the kernel density function curves. In this study, the KDE calculation is presented as follows [【62†41】]: \n\n$$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{nh}{\\sum}_{i=1}^tK\\left(\\frac{x_i-x}{h}\\right) $$\n\n(2) \n\nIn Eq. (【63†2】), n is the total number of locations, x i is the value of i th population aging indicators, and h is the bandwidth. K is a kernel density function and the Gaussian kernel was adopted in this paper.\n\n### Coefficient of variation\n\nThe coefficient of variation (COV) is an effective method to measure the dispersion degree of an indicator [【64†42】, 【65†43】]. The COV is indicated in convergence analysis because it does not depend on the measurement unit and the measure order of the indicators [【66†44】]. In this paper, this method is adopted which could be shown as follows: \n\n$$ {\\sigma}_t=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}_{i=1}^n{\\left({x}_t-{\\overline{x}}_t\\right)}^2}}{{\\overline{x}}_t} $$\n\n(3) \n\nIn Eq. (【67†3】), t refers to the year, and n denotes the total number of provinces. x represents the population aging indicators and \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean value in year t. σ t represents the COV of the selected indicators. In this paper, the calculation of COV expresses the dispersion degree of the population aging indicators compared to the average levels.\n\n#### Evolution patterns analysis \n\nThe center of gravity is a physical concept. Then, it has been widely adopted to investigate spatial distribution, such as population [【32†14】], energy consumption [【68†45】], carbon emissions [【69†46】], and economic growth [【70†47】], etc. In this paper, the center of gravity method was used to analyze the spatial evolution of population aging and social-economic indicators. Each provincial-level administrative region is assumed to be located on a homogeneous two-dimension surface without accounting for the altitude dimension, and that the indicators by each region are concentrated in the provincial capital cities. Each provincial capital city then acts as a particle on the surface, with weights determined based on the indicator’s quantity. This simplification is a necessary step because finer-grained data (e.g., at the prefectural and county levels) is not yet available in this study. Then, the spatial positions of the gravity centers were calculated according to a combination of the geographical coordinates of the provincial capital cities and their corresponding weights. The position of the gravity center is expressed in terms of longitude and latitude, which can be calculated as follows: \n\n$$ {X}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{x}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(4) \n\n$$ {Y}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{y}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(5) \n\nIn Eq. (【71†4】) and (【72†5】), X t and Y t are the longitude and latitude coordinates of the gravity center in year t, respectively. M ti represents the population aging and social-economic indicators by province i in year t. (x i, y i) represent the longitude and latitude coordinates of the provincial capital city of province i, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial movement distance for the gravity center can be expressed as follows: \n\n$$ {D}_{t2-t1}=\\sqrt{{\\left({X}_{t2}-{X}_{t1}\\right)}^2+{\\left({Y}_{t2}-{Y}_{t1}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(6) \n\nIn Eq. (【73†6】), D _{t2-t1} is the movement distance of the gravity center (km) between the year t _{2} and t _{1}, and X _{t1}, X t2, and Y _{t1}, Y _{t2} are gravity center coordinates for the years t _{1} and t _{2}. The differences in the movement of these gravity centers represent the changes in the balance over time. In this paper, Arc GIS software (version 10.2) was used to calculate the gravity centers in each year and connect each center in turn to define the movement paths followed by these centers annually from 2002 to 2018.\n\n#### Bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis \n\nBivariate spatial autocorrelation is considered to be the correlation between one variable and the spatial lag of another variable [【74†48】]. The bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis is commonly indexed by bivariate Moran’s I, whereas the original Moran’s I statistic measured the degree of linear association of the values of a variable in neighboring regions. The bivariate Moran’s I statistic provides an indication of the degree of linear association between one variable and a different variable in neighboring regions. Meanwhile, the bivariate local indicators of spatial association (BiLISA) which closely follows that of its global counterpart was applied in this study to capture the relationship between the value for one variable at a location and the average of the neighboring values for another variable [【74†48】]. In this study, bivariate Moran’s I between population aging indicators and social-economic factors were calculated and the cluster maps of BiLISA were drawn with a p-value < 0.05 which were performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n#### Exploratory data analysis \n\nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated between population aging indicators and social-economic factors during the study period. The results showed that Pearson’s correlation coefficients were positively significant in most years based on two-tailed tests (see the supplementary tables).\n\n## Results\n\n### Spatial-temporal variations and distribution patterns\n\n#### Overall spatial-temporal variations \n\nThe variation of population aging and social-economic factors at the provincial level in China with a five-year interval in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were depicted in Fig. 【75†1】. Several key points of the spatial-temporal variation trend can be concluded. First, the spatial difference of two population aging indicators showed a similarity that the eastern part of China (e.g., Liaoning, Beijing, Jiangsu) and Sichuan Province exhibited the highest values, and most provinces in the western part of China showed relatively lower values. Further, several provinces in southern China such as Guangdong and Fujian provinces showe","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":30,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":1701,"end_ix":1712,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Annual articles published in scientific and technical journals per million people - Our World in Data","url":"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/scientific-publications-per-million","text":"\nURL: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/scientific-publications-per-million\n【0†Our World in Data】\n\n[Image 0: Oxford Martin School logo][Image 1: Global Change Data Lab logo]\n\n  * Browse by topic\n\n  * 【1†Latest】\n  * Resources\n\n  * 【2†About】\n\nSubscribe\n\n【3†Donate】\n\n[Image 2]\n\nData \n\n# Annual articles published in scientific and technical journals per million people\n\n  * Explore the Data \n  * Research & Writing \n  * Related Data \n  * All Charts \n  * FAQs\n  * 【4†Sources & Processing】\n  * 【5†Reuse This Work】\n\n[Image 3]\n\n## What you should know about this indicator \n\n  * Scientific and technical journal articles per million people are calculated by Our World in Data based on article data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, and population estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.\n  * Patents are assigned based on the residence country of the first-named applicant.\n\n#### How is this data described by its producer?\n\nScientific and technical journal articles refer to the number of scientific and engineering articles published in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine, biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.

The BG Strategy breaks down the BE into five main sectors: Biotechnology, Renewable Energy, Coastal and Maritime Tourism, Aquaculture and Mineral Resources, and integrates other sectors such as fishing, transportation, offshore oil and gas extraction, and ship construction and repair.\n\nBiotechnology presents excellent opportunities to produce natural products with possible applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors [【49†105】, 【50†119】]. It is a recent and developing sector that is part of the bioeconomy, the latter developing and using renewable biological resources from the land and sea. For example, the cultivation of seaweed is expected to provide sustainable biomass that facilitates the development of the marine bioeconomy through BG [【51†43】] and is considered an industrial benchmark for achieving a competitive, circular, and sustainable economy that is less dependent on fossil carbon [【52†9】].\n\nRenewable wind energy from marine sources and the conversion of thermal energy from the ocean is increasingly present at the global ocean level [【53†126】, 【54†129】]. Novel hybrid robust/stochastic approaches are used to participate in the electricity market, including renewable energy procurement through large consumer purchases that respond to the energy demands of wind turbines voyer (WT), photovoltaic systems (PV), bilateral contracts (BCs), and micro-turbines (MTs), and energy storage systems (ESS) [【55†1】]. Other strategies focus on the optimal programming of electrical energy consumption in multiple cooling systems [【56†108】] or models based on heat and energy centers [【57†70】].\n\nTourism has played a decisive role in developing many island economies, triggering other activities to obtain local economic returns. Similarly, aquaculture and fisheries have contributed to the economic development of certain regions without jeopardizing access to essential resources such as small-scale fisheries [【58†15】, 【59†39】, 【45†109】]. The exploitation and extraction of offshore oil and gas is a reality in many economies around the world wherein nations must weigh the economic benefits against the negative impact it may have on living marine resources [【60†78】, 【61†92】, 【44†131】].\n\nGlobally, shipping is the primary means of supplying raw materials, consumer goods, and energy, becoming a facilitator of world trade and contributing to economic growth and employment, both at sea and on land [【62†81】]. In addition, the shipbuilding industry provides real added value to numerous coastal communities [【63†114】].\n\nThrough bibliometric analysis, this study’s main objective is to explore the evolution of worldwide scientific production on BE between 1979 and 2020. The purpose is also to identify those concepts that are related to BE in order to subsequently carry out the study of keywords and establish future research trends.\n\nIts main contribution is the assimilation of the BE into the CE since both are key to supporting BG and guaranteeing the sustainability of economic activities developed within the blue context. BE encompasses activities related to renewable energy use, waste management, climate change, fisheries and tourism, where the concept of economic circulation (based on recycling, extension, redistribution and manufacturing) can be integrated, moving from a linear economy to an economy that makes the most of waste through circular flow [【64†60】, 【65†112】, 【66†133】]. Analyzing the possible connections, we start from the study carried out by Ruiz-Real et al. [【67†107】], referring to the analysis of the global dynamics of the CE, where trend words related to renewable energy, climate change and waste management are located, finding an explicit link with almost all of the activities promoted by the BE shown in Fig. 【68†2】. Furthermore, although there is no visible link on the fisheries and water issue in the BE and CE, it should be mentioned that fisheries depend on water, as their life cycle depends on this natural environment and both its conditions (quality, temperature, salinity) and its proper management influence the sustainability and conservation of marine species [【69†36】, 【70†106】].\n\nFig. 2\n\n[Image 1: figure 2]\n\nAnalysis of relationships between BE and CE\n\n【71†Full size image】\n\nAn important aspect relates to the conflict between the interest groups of BD versus the economic development proposed by both the BE and the BG. Thus, the CE presents itself as a mediator between growth, economic development and employment while extending resource availability and reducing environmental and social pressures.\n\n## Methodology \n\nBibliometry offers useful results from the authors’ production in a field of research, trends, the most cited articles, and the concentration of documents in impact journals [【72†63】].\n\nThe first step was to select the terms through a prior review of those economies linked to the seas and oceans, with BE, BG, ME, and OE being the most representative terms.\n\nThe next step involved locating and extracting data on all the documents in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection that contain the terms established in the search criteria in order to visualize the behavior of scientific production over time, providing high-quality data and a complete description that facilitates data processing and for the broad recognition it has obtained in the scientific community [【73†89】, 【74†98】]. For this study, the WoS database was selected. This database is widely recognized for gathering reliable and multidisciplinary research, with studies recommending its use due to the high proportion of exclusive journals [【75†83】].\n\nA similar search query was carried out on the Scopus database using the same criteria to guarantee the data’s completeness. The results were similar to those obtained from WoS [【76†44】, 【77†53】, 【78†80】].\n\nThe data was then processed to analyze the number of articles published per year, the number of citations, and their h-index. Bibliometric analysis, the study of the scientific activity of authors, has been used to prepare this article and has been used in various areas.\n\nFigure 【79†3】 depicts the descriptive statistical analysis of the main variables: cites per article, total cites, h-index, year, and articles. The matrix indicates the correlation between them (the closer to 1, the stronger the correlation; if the values are closer to − 1, there is an inverse correlation between variables, while if there is a zero value, there is no correlation). In the present case, the articles variable is highly correlated with the total of citations, h-index, and years. In contrast, there is an inverse correlation with the variable cites per article and year.\n\nFig. 3\n\n[Image 2: figure 3]\n\nCorrelation matrix of main variables\n\n【80†Full size image】\n\nIn this work, the number of articles, citations, citations per article, and h-index, the most relevant countries, institutions, and authors are studied. The keywords are also taken into account in order to discover new lines of research. A database search has been carried out, filtering by topic in the title, the abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus. The search for the keywords was carried out using the terms: “blue economy” or “ocean economy” or “blue growth” or “maritime economy” or “marine economy.” In the next stage, 780 results were obtained, from which articles were filtered, leaving 499 articles to be processed and analyzed in the fourth stage. The results were then filtered to include only articles as many of them have been published in journals with an impact factor in Journal Citation Reports (JCR). This indicator is highly regarded and valued by organizations that evaluate research activity, guaranteeing a strict review process and high-quality results [【81†32】, 【82†47】, 【83†82】].\n\nLastly, once the document search was filtered to include only articles, the data were exported and processed using two tools: Vosviewer and Biblioshiny. In this way, clusters can be created by downloading information from the Web of Science database.\n\nThe VOSviewer program offers the basic functionality necessary to visualize bibliometric networks, citation links between publications, collaboration between researchers, and co-occurrence links between scientific terms [【84†128】]. According to a logical bibliometric workflow, the Bibliometrix tool, developed in the statistical and graphical language R, is also used to add weight to the study. R is highly extensible as it uses a functional, object-oriented programming language, and therefore it is relatively easy to automate parsing and create new functions. It is utilized to create graphs for three metrics at different levels: sources, authors, and documents, and analyzing knowledge structures at the conceptual, intellectual and social level [【85†5】] (Fig. 【86†4】).\n\nFig. 4\n\n[Image 3: figure 4]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS)\n\nThe data collection process\n\n【87†Full size image】\n\n## Results\n\n### Descriptive analysis \n\nFigure 【88†5】 represents a descriptive analysis of the terms ME, OE, BE, and BG, making a note of the chronological order of the articles when these concepts first appeared.\n\nFig. 5\n\n[Image 4: figure 5]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS data)\n\nTimeline of first published articles related to BE, BG, ME, and OE\n\n【89†Full size image】\n\nThe first mention of ME appeared in 1979 in the article entitled “Marine Economy of Poland 1945–1975”.

Therefore, in this study, two main social-economic factors including per capita Gross Regional Product (GRP_{pc}) and urban population rate (UPR) were collected at the provincial level in China (Table 【53†1】). The UPR was calculated as the proportion (%) of people living in urban areas of the total population. \n\nTable 1 Indicator selected in the study (2002–2018)\n\n【54†Full size table】\n\n### Methodology\n\n#### Distribution pattern detection\n\n### Global spatial autocorrelation\n\nGlobal spatial autocorrelation indexed by Moran’s I method is a powerful tool to quantitatively provide the indicators varying geographically and to explore the spatial autocorrelation among samples [【55†35】]. This method has been widely applied to examine spatial patterns, i.e., clustered, dispersed, or random distributions [【56†36】,【57†37】,【58†38】,【59†39】]. To explore the spatial autocorrelation of population aging indicators, Moran’s I was adopted in this paper, which can be calculated as follows [【60†40】]: \n\n$$ I=\\frac{n\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)\\left({x}_j-\\overline{x}\\right)}{\\sum_i^n{\\sum}_j^n{W}_{ij}\\times {\\sum}_i^n{\\left({x}_i-\\overline{x}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(1) \n\nIn Eq. (【61†1】), n represents the number of spatial units (the province in this case) indexed by i and j; x represents the selected variables; \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean of x; the weights W ij are written in an (n × n) weight matrix which depicts the relationship between the variable and its surrounding ones. In the current study, the contiguity-based method was conducted for identifying the weight matrix, and the queen criterion as spatial units sharing a common edge or a vertex was selected to determine neighbors. The global spatial autocorrelation was performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n### Kernel density estimation\n\nKernel density estimation (KDE) is commonly used to estimate the density function based on a set of observations and random variables from an unknown distribution function. This method does not need any hypothesis for the data distribution. Thus, the general distribution patterns in population aging indicators can be described visually based on the kernel density function curves. In this study, the KDE calculation is presented as follows [【62†41】]: \n\n$$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{nh}{\\sum}_{i=1}^tK\\left(\\frac{x_i-x}{h}\\right) $$\n\n(2) \n\nIn Eq. (【63†2】), n is the total number of locations, x i is the value of i th population aging indicators, and h is the bandwidth. K is a kernel density function and the Gaussian kernel was adopted in this paper.\n\n### Coefficient of variation\n\nThe coefficient of variation (COV) is an effective method to measure the dispersion degree of an indicator [【64†42】, 【65†43】]. The COV is indicated in convergence analysis because it does not depend on the measurement unit and the measure order of the indicators [【66†44】]. In this paper, this method is adopted which could be shown as follows: \n\n$$ {\\sigma}_t=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}{\\sum}_{i=1}^n{\\left({x}_t-{\\overline{x}}_t\\right)}^2}}{{\\overline{x}}_t} $$\n\n(3) \n\nIn Eq. (【67†3】), t refers to the year, and n denotes the total number of provinces. x represents the population aging indicators and \\( \\overline{x} \\) is the mean value in year t. σ t represents the COV of the selected indicators. In this paper, the calculation of COV expresses the dispersion degree of the population aging indicators compared to the average levels.\n\n#### Evolution patterns analysis \n\nThe center of gravity is a physical concept. Then, it has been widely adopted to investigate spatial distribution, such as population [【32†14】], energy consumption [【68†45】], carbon emissions [【69†46】], and economic growth [【70†47】], etc. In this paper, the center of gravity method was used to analyze the spatial evolution of population aging and social-economic indicators. Each provincial-level administrative region is assumed to be located on a homogeneous two-dimension surface without accounting for the altitude dimension, and that the indicators by each region are concentrated in the provincial capital cities. Each provincial capital city then acts as a particle on the surface, with weights determined based on the indicator’s quantity. This simplification is a necessary step because finer-grained data (e.g., at the prefectural and county levels) is not yet available in this study. Then, the spatial positions of the gravity centers were calculated according to a combination of the geographical coordinates of the provincial capital cities and their corresponding weights. The position of the gravity center is expressed in terms of longitude and latitude, which can be calculated as follows: \n\n$$ {X}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{x}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(4) \n\n$$ {Y}_t=\\frac{\\sum {M}_{ti}{y}_i}{\\sum {M}_{ti}} $$\n\n(5) \n\nIn Eq. (【71†4】) and (【72†5】), X t and Y t are the longitude and latitude coordinates of the gravity center in year t, respectively. M ti represents the population aging and social-economic indicators by province i in year t. (x i, y i) represent the longitude and latitude coordinates of the provincial capital city of province i, respectively. Furthermore, the spatial movement distance for the gravity center can be expressed as follows: \n\n$$ {D}_{t2-t1}=\\sqrt{{\\left({X}_{t2}-{X}_{t1}\\right)}^2+{\\left({Y}_{t2}-{Y}_{t1}\\right)}^2} $$\n\n(6) \n\nIn Eq. (【73†6】), D _{t2-t1} is the movement distance of the gravity center (km) between the year t _{2} and t _{1}, and X _{t1}, X t2, and Y _{t1}, Y _{t2} are gravity center coordinates for the years t _{1} and t _{2}. The differences in the movement of these gravity centers represent the changes in the balance over time. In this paper, Arc GIS software (version 10.2) was used to calculate the gravity centers in each year and connect each center in turn to define the movement paths followed by these centers annually from 2002 to 2018.\n\n#### Bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis \n\nBivariate spatial autocorrelation is considered to be the correlation between one variable and the spatial lag of another variable [【74†48】]. The bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis is commonly indexed by bivariate Moran’s I, whereas the original Moran’s I statistic measured the degree of linear association of the values of a variable in neighboring regions. The bivariate Moran’s I statistic provides an indication of the degree of linear association between one variable and a different variable in neighboring regions. Meanwhile, the bivariate local indicators of spatial association (BiLISA) which closely follows that of its global counterpart was applied in this study to capture the relationship between the value for one variable at a location and the average of the neighboring values for another variable [【74†48】]. In this study, bivariate Moran’s I between population aging indicators and social-economic factors were calculated and the cluster maps of BiLISA were drawn with a p-value < 0.05 which were performed by using GeoDa software (version 1.18).\n\n#### Exploratory data analysis \n\nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated between population aging indicators and social-economic factors during the study period. The results showed that Pearson’s correlation coefficients were positively significant in most years based on two-tailed tests (see the supplementary tables).\n\n## Results\n\n### Spatial-temporal variations and distribution patterns\n\n#### Overall spatial-temporal variations \n\nThe variation of population aging and social-economic factors at the provincial level in China with a five-year interval in 2005, 2010, and 2015 were depicted in Fig. 【75†1】. Several key points of the spatial-temporal variation trend can be concluded. First, the spatial difference of two population aging indicators showed a similarity that the eastern part of China (e.g., Liaoning, Beijing, Jiangsu) and Sichuan Province exhibited the highest values, and most provinces in the western part of China showed relatively lower values. Further, several provinces in southern China such as Guangdong and Fujian provinces showe","attribution":"bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com","icon_type":null},{"matched_text":"【31†source】","start_idx":1701,"end_idx":1712,"alt":null,"type":"webpage_extended","title":"Annual articles published in scientific and technical journals per million people - Our World in Data","url":"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/scientific-publications-per-million","pub_date":null,"snippet":"\nURL: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/scientific-publications-per-million\n【0†Our World in Data】\n\n[Image 0: Oxford Martin School logo][Image 1: Global Change Data Lab logo]\n\n  * Browse by topic\n\n  * 【1†Latest】\n  * Resources\n\n  * 【2†About】\n\nSubscribe\n\n【3†Donate】\n\n[Image 2]\n\nData \n\n# Annual articles published in scientific and technical journals per million people\n\n  * Explore the Data \n  * Research & Writing \n  * Related Data \n  * All Charts \n  * FAQs\n  * 【4†Sources & Processing】\n  * 【5†Reuse This Work】\n\n[Image 3]\n\n## What you should know about this indicator \n\n  * Scientific and technical journal articles per million people are calculated by Our World in Data based on article data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, and population estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.\n  * Patents are assigned based on the residence country of the first-named applicant.\n\n#### How is this data described by its producer?\n\nScientific and technical journal articles refer to the number of scientific and engineering articles published in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine, biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.

The purpose is also to identify those concepts that are related to BE in order to subsequently carry out the study of keywords and establish future research trends.\n\nIts main contribution is the assimilation of the BE into the CE since both are key to supporting BG and guaranteeing the sustainability of economic activities developed within the blue context. BE encompasses activities related to renewable energy use, waste management, climate change, fisheries and tourism, where the concept of economic circulation (based on recycling, extension, redistribution and manufacturing) can be integrated, moving from a linear economy to an economy that makes the most of waste through circular flow [【64†60】, 【65†112】, 【66†133】]. Analyzing the possible connections, we start from the study carried out by Ruiz-Real et al. [【67†107】], referring to the analysis of the global dynamics of the CE, where trend words related to renewable energy, climate change and waste management are located, finding an explicit link with almost all of the activities promoted by the BE shown in Fig. 【68†2】. Furthermore, although there is no visible link on the fisheries and water issue in the BE and CE, it should be mentioned that fisheries depend on water, as their life cycle depends on this natural environment and both its conditions (quality, temperature, salinity) and its proper management influence the sustainability and conservation of marine species [【69†36】, 【70†106】].\n\nFig. 2\n\n[Image 1: figure 2]\n\nAnalysis of relationships between BE and CE\n\n【71†Full size image】\n\nAn important aspect relates to the conflict between the interest groups of BD versus the economic development proposed by both the BE and the BG. Thus, the CE presents itself as a mediator between growth, economic development and employment while extending resource availability and reducing environmental and social pressures.\n\n## Methodology \n\nBibliometry offers useful results from the authors’ production in a field of research, trends, the most cited articles, and the concentration of documents in impact journals [【72†63】].\n\nThe first step was to select the terms through a prior review of those economies linked to the seas and oceans, with BE, BG, ME, and OE being the most representative terms.\n\nThe next step involved locating and extracting data on all the documents in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection that contain the terms established in the search criteria in order to visualize the behavior of scientific production over time, providing high-quality data and a complete description that facilitates data processing and for the broad recognition it has obtained in the scientific community [【73†89】, 【74†98】]. For this study, the WoS database was selected. This database is widely recognized for gathering reliable and multidisciplinary research, with studies recommending its use due to the high proportion of exclusive journals [【75†83】].\n\nA similar search query was carried out on the Scopus database using the same criteria to guarantee the data’s completeness. The results were similar to those obtained from WoS [【76†44】, 【77†53】, 【78†80】].\n\nThe data was then processed to analyze the number of articles published per year, the number of citations, and their h-index. Bibliometric analysis, the study of the scientific activity of authors, has been used to prepare this article and has been used in various areas.\n\nFigure 【79†3】 depicts the descriptive statistical analysis of the main variables: cites per article, total cites, h-index, year, and articles. The matrix indicates the correlation between them (the closer to 1, the stronger the correlation; if the values are closer to − 1, there is an inverse correlation between variables, while if there is a zero value, there is no correlation). In the present case, the articles variable is highly correlated with the total of citations, h-index, and years. In contrast, there is an inverse correlation with the variable cites per article and year.\n\nFig. 3\n\n[Image 2: figure 3]\n\nCorrelation matrix of main variables\n\n【80†Full size image】\n\nIn this work, the number of articles, citations, citations per article, and h-index, the most relevant countries, institutions, and authors are studied. The keywords are also taken into account in order to discover new lines of research. A database search has been carried out, filtering by topic in the title, the abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus. The search for the keywords was carried out using the terms: “blue economy” or “ocean economy” or “blue growth” or “maritime economy” or “marine economy.” In the next stage, 780 results were obtained, from which articles were filtered, leaving 499 articles to be processed and analyzed in the fourth stage. The results were then filtered to include only articles as many of them have been published in journals with an impact factor in Journal Citation Reports (JCR). This indicator is highly regarded and valued by organizations that evaluate research activity, guaranteeing a strict review process and high-quality results [【81†32】, 【82†47】, 【83†82】].\n\nLastly, once the document search was filtered to include only articles, the data were exported and processed using two tools: Vosviewer and Biblioshiny. In this way, clusters can be created by downloading information from the Web of Science database.\n\nThe VOSviewer program offers the basic functionality necessary to visualize bibliometric networks, citation links between publications, collaboration between researchers, and co-occurrence links between scientific terms [【84†128】]. According to a logical bibliometric workflow, the Bibliometrix tool, developed in the statistical and graphical language R, is also used to add weight to the study. R is highly extensible as it uses a functional, object-oriented programming language, and therefore it is relatively easy to automate parsing and create new functions. It is utilized to create graphs for three metrics at different levels: sources, authors, and documents, and analyzing knowledge structures at the conceptual, intellectual and social level [【85†5】] (Fig. 【86†4】).\n\nFig. 4\n\n[Image 3: figure 4]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS)\n\nThe data collection process\n\n【87†Full size image】\n\n## Results\n\n### Descriptive analysis \n\nFigure 【88†5】 represents a descriptive analysis of the terms ME, OE, BE, and BG, making a note of the chronological order of the articles when these concepts first appeared.\n\nFig. 5\n\n[Image 4: figure 5]\n\n(Source: own compilation based on WoS data)\n\nTimeline of first published articles related to BE, BG, ME, and OE\n\n【89†Full size image】\n\nThe first mention of ME appeared in 1979 in the article entitled “Marine Economy of Poland 1945–1975”.

Há, de fato, um hiato entre esses dois aspectos, e a IA, por si só, não garante necessariamente a melhoria da qualidade de vida. Aqui está uma análise inicial sobre o tema:\n\n### Crescimento Tecnológico e IA\n\n1. **Investimento Privado e Avanços Tecnológicos**:\n   - Grandes empresas como Google, Microsoft, Amazon e outras têm investido bilhões de dólares em pesquisa e desenvolvimento de IA. Esses investimentos resultam em avanços tecnológicos significativos que têm aplicações em várias áreas, desde automação industrial até serviços de consumo como assistentes virtuais.\n   - **Retorno Financeiro**: Essas empresas buscam retorno financeiro através da implementação de IA em seus produtos e serviços, melhorando eficiência, reduzindo custos operacionais e criando novas fontes de receita.\n\n2. **Concentração de Capacidades**:\n   - A capacidade avançada de IA está concentrada em um pequeno grupo de empresas e países. Isso pode levar a uma disparidade global no acesso a tecnologias de ponta, com países desenvolvidos avançando rapidamente enquanto países em desenvolvimento ficam para trás.\n\n### Qualidade de Vida e Responsabilidade Governamental\n\n1. **Serviços Públicos e Infraestrutura**:\n   - A qualidade de vida depende em grande parte dos serviços públicos oferecidos pelos governos, como saúde, educação, segurança, saneamento básico, e habitação. Esses serviços são essenciais para o bem-estar das populações e variam amplamente entre os países.\n   - **Governança e Política Pública**: A implementação e a eficácia dessas políticas públicas dependem da governança e das prioridades políticas de cada país. Governos eficientes e transparentes tendem a oferecer melhor qualidade de vida aos seus cidadãos.\n\n2. **Impacto da IA na Qualidade de Vida**:\n   - A IA tem potencial para melhorar a qualidade de vida, por exemplo, através de diagnósticos médicos mais precisos, sistemas de transporte mais eficientes, e personalização da educação. No entanto, esses benefícios dependem de como a IA é implementada e acessível à população.\n   - **Desigualdade Digital**: A falta de acesso igualitário à tecnologia pode exacerbar desigualdades existentes. Pessoas e comunidades sem acesso a tecnologias avançadas podem não se beneficiar dos avanços em IA.\n\n### Hiato Entre Crescimento Tecnológico e Qualidade de Vida\n\n1. **Desigualdade Econômica e Digital**:\n   - Há um hiato significativo entre o crescimento tecnológico e a qualidade de vida. Este hiato é evidenciado pela desigualdade econômica e digital, onde apenas uma parte da população global tem acesso aos benefícios diretos dos avanços tecnológicos.\n\n2. **Obrigações Governamentais**:\n   - A responsabilidade de melhorar a qualidade de vida recai, em grande parte, sobre os governos. Eles devem garantir que os avanços tecnológicos sejam integrados de maneira que beneficiem toda a população, não apenas um segmento específico.\n   - **Políticas de Inclusão Digital**: Governos precisam implementar políticas que promovam a inclusão digital, garantindo que tecnologias avançadas sejam acessíveis e utilizadas para melhorar a qualidade de vida de todos os cidadãos.\n\n### Referências e Estudos Adicionais\n\n- **Kai-Fu Lee e Chen Qiufan** em \"2041: Como a inteligência artificial vai mudar sua vida nas próximas décadas\" discutem os impactos futuros da IA na sociedade e economia.\n- **Relatórios da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS)** e **Banco Mundial** fornecem dados sobre indicadores de qualidade de vida.\n- **Estudos sobre desigualdade digital** publicados por instituições como a **UNESCO** e **Banco Mundial**.\n\n### Conclusão\n\nEmbora a IA tenha o potencial de transformar positivamente a sociedade, o hiato entre crescimento tecnológico e qualidade de vida é real e preocupante. Governos e instituições devem trabalhar para garantir que os avanços tecnológicos sejam utilizados para melhorar a vida de todos, através de políticas inclusivas e equitativas. A responsabilidade de melhorar a qualidade de vida é compartilhada entre a inovação tecnológica e a implementação eficaz de políticas públicas.\n\nSe precisar de mais informações ou fontes específicas para aprofundar o seu estudo, estou à disposição para ajudar!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"47c950e3-cd6b-49d8-83bf-fbdfd8483ec3","request_id":"892b98a4de957e0a-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"47c950e3-cd6b-49d8-83bf-fbdfd8483ec3","children":["d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24"]},"d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24":{"id":"d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24","message":{"id":"d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277109.454569,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["agora que já temos fontes confiáveis para fazer uma comparação e análise entre os dois blocos, Tecnologia e Qualidade de vida, representados respectivamente pela Lei de Moore aplicada para os equipamentos e o avanço da IA e de outro lado os indicados de qualidade de vida podemos montar a estrutura de um esboço para apresentar ao Phd  Walter, meu orientador do pós doutorado na USP"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8931a45c49857e0b-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"a63ebc52-d2e7-4ae7-8fd5-09940fc5d4d7","children":["dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a"]},"dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a":{"id":"dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a","message":{"id":"dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277151.570926,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24","request_id":"8931a45c49857e0b-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d26d54c3-1520-4ddb-b7bb-6a9a783fed24","children":["6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144"]},"6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144":{"id":"6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144","message":{"id":"6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277151.570983,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Marcos está preparando um esboço para apresentar ao PhD Walter, seu orientador do pós-doutorado na USP, sobre a disparidade entre o crescimento tecnológico e a qualidade de vida, utilizando a Lei de Moore e os indicadores de qualidade de vida."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":false,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200007]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a","request_id":"8931a45c49857e0b-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"bio","channel":null},"parent":"dc4f04d5-e229-47a3-afa6-9ae21907840a","children":["ad4f84bb-48dc-45a7-886f-f213ef030873"]},"ad4f84bb-48dc-45a7-886f-f213ef030873":{"id":"ad4f84bb-48dc-45a7-886f-f213ef030873","message":{"id":"ad4f84bb-48dc-45a7-886f-f213ef030873","author":{"role":"tool","name":"bio","metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277151.571023,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Model set context updated."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"kwargs":{"message_id":"ad4f84bb-48dc-45a7-886f-f213ef030873"},"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AA","parent_id":"6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144","request_id":"8931a45c49857e0b-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"assistant","channel":null},"parent":"6da582eb-4101-4b41-88f7-46f0088d7144","children":["96b72845-ab87-44d9-b97e-3083057fd42e"]},"96b72845-ab87-44d9-b97e-3083057fd42e":{"id":"96b72845-ab87-44d9-b97e-3083057fd42e","message":{"id":"96b72845-ab87-44d9-b97e-3083057fd42e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277151.57106,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Aqui está um esboço estruturado para sua apresentação ao PhD Walter sobre a disparidade entre o crescimento tecnológico (representado pela Lei de Moore e avanços em IA) e a qualidade de vida, utilizando indicadores específicos de ambos os blocos:\n\n---\n\n## Título: Disparidade Entre o Crescimento Tecnológico e a Qualidade de Vida\n\n### 1.

Especificamente, a Lei de Moore postula que o número de transistores em um chip de circuito integrado dobra aproximadamente a cada dois anos, levando a um aumento exponencial na capacidade de processamento dos computadores.\n\n### Lei de Moore: Observação e Impulso ao Crescimento\n\n1. **Observação do Crescimento Tecnológico**:\n   - A Lei de Moore foi proposta por Gordon E. Moore em 1965, baseada na observação dos avanços na tecnologia de semicondutores até aquela época. Moore previu que essa tendência continuaria, o que se confirmou em grande parte nas décadas seguintes.\n   - Fonte: [Moore's Original Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)\n\n2. **Impulso ao Crescimento Tecnológico**:\n   - Embora a Lei de Moore seja uma observação, ela também tem funcionado como uma meta para a indústria de semicondutores. Os fabricantes de chips usaram a previsão de Moore como um objetivo a ser alcançado, investindo significativamente em pesquisa e desenvolvimento para manter o ritmo do aumento de transistores e, consequentemente, da capacidade de processamento.\n   - Esse esforço contínuo resultou em avanços tecnológicos que beneficiam uma ampla gama de áreas, incluindo a IA.\n\n### Relação entre Lei de Moore e Crescimento Tecnológico\n\n- **Catalisador e Meta**:\n  - A Lei de Moore serve como um catalisador ao proporcionar uma meta clara para a indústria de semicondutores. Empresas como Intel, AMD, e outras fabricantes de chips trabalham para inovar e desenvolver novas tecnologias que permitem a miniaturização contínua dos transistores.\n  - Fonte: [Intel's Perspective on Moore's Law](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html)\n\n- **Feedback Positivo**:\n  - Os avanços resultantes do esforço para manter a Lei de Moore, por sua vez, alimentam mais inovação tecnológica. Com mais capacidade de processamento disponível, novas aplicações e tecnologias se tornam possíveis, estimulando ainda mais o crescimento tecnológico.\n  - Isso cria um ciclo de feedback positivo onde a observação da Lei de Moore e os avanços tecnológicos se reforçam mutuamente.\n\n### Análise e Contexto\n\nA Lei de Moore é, portanto, uma descrição do ritmo do avanço tecnológico, mas também atua como um objetivo para a indústria de semicondutores. Esse duplo papel contribui para a rápida evolução da tecnologia que observamos desde a sua formulação.\n\n**Conclusão**: A Lei de Moore não é a causa do crescimento tecnológico, mas sim uma medida que descreve esse crescimento e, ao mesmo tempo, inspira esforços contínuos para manter seu ritmo. A indústria de semicondutores tem usado essa observação como uma meta, investindo em inovações que permitam continuar o aumento exponencial da capacidade de processamento, o que, por sua vez, impulsiona ainda mais o crescimento tecnológico.\n\nSe precisar de mais detalhes ou tiver outras perguntas, estou à disposição para ajudar!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"312c3e8a-03f2-46a2-ae6b-304295737e92","request_id":"8931a7849c397e0b-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"312c3e8a-03f2-46a2-ae6b-304295737e92","children":["c3bc07da-6acf-4236-a1c0-c2f863646170"]},"c3bc07da-6acf-4236-a1c0-c2f863646170":{"id":"c3bc07da-6acf-4236-a1c0-c2f863646170","message":{"id":"c3bc07da-6acf-4236-a1c0-c2f863646170","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277298.535412,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["entao precisamos atualizar a estrutura da apresentação "]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1.0,"metadata":{"request_id":"8931a8f9ff627e0b-GRU","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e499011d-0a6e-4305-b727-0468a6db0afa","children":["d405410f-cd5a-4d1d-b73e-ff7303b0391e"]},"d405410f-cd5a-4d1d-b73e-ff7303b0391e":{"id":"d405410f-cd5a-4d1d-b73e-ff7303b0391e","message":{"id":"d405410f-cd5a-4d1d-b73e-ff7303b0391e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718277354.309251,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Vamos atualizar a estrutura da apresentação para refletir a relação entre a Lei de Moore como uma observação do crescimento tecnológico e o impacto dessa evolução na qualidade de vida.

He said, \"We'll sell you the complete circuit for less than you can buy the individual components to build your own.\"\n\nThat was the key thing that got them over the hump of, oh, OK, it's cheaper that way. We'll use integrated circuits. And from those very simple circuits it's grown in complexity. We've had to bring more and more and more and more of the stuff onto the chip. And the result is, in technology, it often swallows the customer's added value and gives it back to them free.\n\nThe customers that understand that, anticipate it and use it, have been very successful. Those that try to resist it find themselves spending a lot of time and energy and money on things that their competitors don't.\n\nSo I view this as the natural direction that technology drives the industry. It's something that you have to accept and try to exploit to move ahead. And it's not really -- the semiconductor manufacturers desire to take all the value added. But, that's nice.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDR. GORDON MOORE: It really is the way that we have to move in we're going to exploit the advantages of the technology today and moving forward.\n\nWhat happens is with a PC board, one month or one year moves on to a chip not much after that. This showing an interface, an Ethernet interface card, moving from some ten chips to a single chip over a time scale like this.\n\nThe other natural consequence of this is that the product complexity continues to increase. And here I show product complexity measured by the number of transistors in the circuits, both for DRAMs, which since you don't waste much space laying out a DRAM, tend to be more complex than the microprocessors, and some of the microprocessors. Actually, the last point of the microprocessors is falling a little below the line. That's not because we can't put more on a chip. It's an economic tradeoff as these chips get fairly large.\n\nThe technology that drives that is our ability to make things smaller, this violation of Murphy's law, for as long as we've been exploiting this technology, which I date from about the first planar transistor in 1959, which is for some -- that's almost 40 years now, 38 years, we've been on a trend that cuts the minimum feature size in half about every six years.\n\nWe actually do a turn of the technology probably twice that often. So over most of this time, the generations of technology have shrunk by the magic 70 percent or to 70 percent of the previous size about once every three years. And as you see, Intel's technology has followed that curve fairly precisely. Some of the early points are missing, but they were pretty much sprinkled on the blue line. And the semiconductor industry road map was put together a few years back for the leading edge technology, again stays on that factor of .7 in minimum features every three years.\n\nAs we get smaller in the X/Y directions it's also important that we shrink the thickness of the films. This shows the insulator thickness in the MOS transistors is a function of the minimum size for various levels of technology.\n\nFrankly, this curve surprises me more than the other one does. The other one is pretty impressive getting down to quarter micron technology now, approaching the wavelength of visible light.\n\nThis one, on the other hand, has gone much further than I would have anticipated. I remember in the early days figuring that probably a thousand angstroms was as thin as it would ever be able to go with insulating layers. Back of the envelope kind of calculations.\n\nThat took a model of atoms plopping in random on a surface, suggested that if you got many fewer atomic layers and down to a thousand angstroms, the likelihood of a pinhole would be high enough that you wouldn't be able to keep the integrity of the film over a very large area.\n\nThat completely neglected the fact that chemical forces are actually working for us here rather than against us. It's not a random dropping of atoms on the surface at all but a very careful build up of a film layer by layer. You can go very much thinner than that. The point furthest on the right there that corresponds to something like 30 angstroms is ten molecular layers thick. And even at that level, we have good integrity of the film. So this can continue to go for a while. I hesitated to extrapolate it beyond the right edge of the curve, but certainly the opportunity to continue moving in that direction exists.\n\nThe impact of these technological changes, making things smaller so they go faster, putting more stuff on a chip, gets reflected in the performance of the devices. And this is the performance of Intel's microprocessors from the original 4004. And as you see, as near as we can measure this, we had something like a 20,000-fold improvement in computing performance over this time frame. And the slope shows no sign of changing.

We'll use integrated circuits. And from those very simple circuits it's grown in complexity. We've had to bring more and more and more and more of the stuff onto the chip. And the result is, in technology, it often swallows the customer's added value and gives it back to them free.\n\nThe customers that understand that, anticipate it and use it, have been very successful. Those that try to resist it find themselves spending a lot of time and energy and money on things that their competitors don't.\n\nSo I view this as the natural direction that technology drives the industry. It's something that you have to accept and try to exploit to move ahead. And it's not really -- the semiconductor manufacturers desire to take all the value added. But, that's nice.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nDR. GORDON MOORE: It really is the way that we have to move in we're going to exploit the advantages of the technology today and moving forward.\n\nWhat happens is with a PC board, one month or one year moves on to a chip not much after that. This showing an interface, an Ethernet interface card, moving from some ten chips to a single chip over a time scale like this.\n\nThe other natural consequence of this is that the product complexity continues to increase. And here I show product complexity measured by the number of transistors in the circuits, both for DRAMs, which since you don't waste much space laying out a DRAM, tend to be more complex than the microprocessors, and some of the microprocessors. Actually, the last point of the microprocessors is falling a little below the line. That's not because we can't put more on a chip. It's an economic tradeoff as these chips get fairly large.\n\nThe technology that drives that is our ability to make things smaller, this violation of Murphy's law, for as long as we've been exploiting this technology, which I date from about the first planar transistor in 1959, which is for some -- that's almost 40 years now, 38 years, we've been on a trend that cuts the minimum feature size in half about every six years.\n\nWe actually do a turn of the technology probably twice that often. So over most of this time, the generations of technology have shrunk by the magic 70 percent or to 70 percent of the previous size about once every three years. And as you see, Intel's technology has followed that curve fairly precisely. Some of the early points are missing, but they were pretty much sprinkled on the blue line. And the semiconductor industry road map was put together a few years back for the leading edge technology, again stays on that factor of .7 in minimum features every three years.\n\nAs we get smaller in the X/Y directions it's also important that we shrink the thickness of the films. This shows the insulator thickness in the MOS transistors is a function of the minimum size for various levels of technology.\n\nFrankly, this curve surprises me more than the other one does. The other one is pretty impressive getting down to quarter micron technology now, approaching the wavelength of visible light.\n\nThis one, on the other hand, has gone much further than I would have anticipated. I remember in the early days figuring that probably a thousand angstroms was as thin as it would ever be able to go with insulating layers. Back of the envelope kind of calculations.\n\nThat took a model of atoms plopping in random on a surface, suggested that if you got many fewer atomic layers and down to a thousand angstroms, the likelihood of a pinhole would be high enough that you wouldn't be able to keep the integrity of the film over a very large area.\n\nThat completely neglected the fact that chemical forces are actually working for us here rather than against us. It's not a random dropping of atoms on the surface at all but a very careful build up of a film layer by layer. You can go very much thinner than that. The point furthest on the right there that corresponds to something like 30 angstroms is ten molecular layers thick. And even at that level, we have good integrity of the film. So this can continue to go for a while. I hesitated to extrapolate it beyond the right edge of the curve, but certainly the opportunity to continue moving in that direction exists.\n\nThe impact of these technological changes, making things smaller so they go faster, putting more stuff on a chip, gets reflected in the performance of the devices. And this is the performance of Intel's microprocessors from the original 4004. And as you see, as near as we can measure this, we had something like a 20,000-fold improvement in computing performance over this time frame. And the slope shows no sign of changing. I think we'll be able to continue this for quite a while by exploiting the capability of this technology when we combine with the advantages that are being made in design.\n\nI don't know quite what this is going to enable in the future, but I have met very few people in your kinds of positions who haven't felt they couldn't take advantage of greater computing power.\n\nNow, a little history to show more graphically, maybe,","pub_date":null,"extra":null}],"original_query":null},"command":"mclick","args":["[\"0\", \"1\", \"3\", \"4\", \"10\"]"],"status":"finished","is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"7024abf8-dd3b-4a30-a5c9-4ab73d27f247","request_id":"8931c0d06e017df1-GRU","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"7024abf8-dd3b-4a30-a5c9-4ab73d27f247","children":["04903c26-f978-4e97-844e-dd5a52161a3b"]},"04903c26-f978-4e97-844e-dd5a52161a3b":{"id":"04903c26-f978-4e97-844e-dd5a52161a3b","message":{"id":"04903c26-f978-4e97-844e-dd5a52161a3b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1718278336.464339,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Aqui está a versão em inglês do esboço em formato Markdown (.md) com o título, subtítulos organizados como índice, e os hyperlinks preservados, incluindo uma fonte específica da Intel para a Lei de Moore:\n\n```markdown\n# Disparity Between Technological Growth and Quality of Life\n\n## 1.

Serbia and the European Union that paves the way for Serbia's eventual EU membership has disheartened officials and residents from Bosnia and Herzegovina who are still waiting to sign a similar agreement. Gallup's most recent poll in Bosnia and Herzegovina found a strong majority saying their country's membership in the EU would be a good thing.\n\n[Image 0]\n\nMany citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have expressed frustration over the agreement with Serbia, whom they say has failed to arrest those guilty of war crimes, a requirement for EU membership. With their own pre-accession agreement stalled because of \"translation issues,\" some residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina likely perceive hesitation on the part of the EU. In 2007, about one in four (23%) told Gallup they did not believe the European Commission wanted their country to join the European Union, although a majority (55%) disagreed.\n\n[Image 1]\n\nWhen asked whether they thought their own leaders were doing what was necessary to join the EU, citizens from Bosnia and Herzegovina were roughly divided with 39% saying \"yes\" and 43% saying \"no.\" While it is uncertain how long it will take Bosnia and Herzegovina to complete the path to EU membership, public opinion reflects hope and frustration among the people there.\n\n[Image 2]\n\nSurvey
