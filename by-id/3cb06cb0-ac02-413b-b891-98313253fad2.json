The present study proposes a traceability system that utilizes RFID and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. RFID technology can be used to track and trace perishable food while IoT sensors can be used to measure temperature and humidity during storage and transportation. Furthermore, it is important that RFID gates can identify the direction of tags and whether products are being received or shipped through the gate. In this study, machine-learning models are utilized to detect the direction of passive RFID tags. The input features are derived from receive signal strength (RSS) and the timestamp of tags. The proposed system has been tested in the perishable food supply chain and has revealed significant benefits to managers and customers by providing real-time product information and complete temperature and humidity history. In addition, by integrating a machine-learning model into the RFID gate, tagged products that move in or out through a gate can be correctly identified and thus improve the efficiency of the traceability system.\",\"paper_authors\":[\"Ganjar Alfian\",\"Muhammad Syafrudin\",\"U.

However, a challenge faced by healthcare industry is the limited adoption and use of RFID by physicians and nurses. This research extended existing work by integrating unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence) and individual differences, namely personality (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeableness and extraversion) and demographic characteristics (i.e. age and gender) to predict the adoption of RFID in the healthcare supply chain. Data was collected from 252 physicians and nurses. The research model was tested by employing neural network analysis. During the course of this research, 11 variables were proposed in a bid to predict the adoption of RFID by physicians and nurses. In general, individual differences are able to predict the adoption of RFID better compared to variables derived from UTAUT. This study contributes to the growing interest in understanding the acceptance of RFID in the healthcare industry.\",\"paper_authors\":[\"A. Chong\",\"Martin J.
